Like Hoole...so like Hoole... He turns a bit, and our eyes meet directly. I can\"t describe it...in this next moment, I don\"t look away, how awkward it seems. I stare into his eyes. They\"re like Hoole\"s... They are Barn Owl eyes, but Hoole\"s eyes. They\"re his eyes...Hoole\"s eyes... They hold that light of valor, justice, that one glow that I always made me feel my gizzard twitch in the bottom of my heart. Hoole... He never wanted me, did he? He loved me, but only who I was pretending to be. He never loved me, only Emerilla...lucky owl. I just wanted to belong -- because I was nothing -- and he gave me that. He was so fair, so kind...he gave me something even Kreeth could not. Mum and Da -- Ygryk and Pleek -- were supposed to be my parents. I was supposed to be their chick, Lutta. Yet they left me. They talked about me behind my back...I was a freak. My own parents loathed me. Oh, they tried, but they left in the end. They didn\"t love me. Kreeth used me. No one really loved me, or even looked at me normally. All I was was a freak, nothing at all. Then he came along. Him, Hoole. The only one who let me belong, looked at me with kindness in his gaze, not looking like I was a...monster... Why was I born? Not one person cared about me. I was just freak my parents didn\"t want, a weapon for auntie\"s uses, and a fake to my only love. He cared, but didn\"t know me. In the end, I was a monster to him too. Now I\"m back. And now I wonder... I suddenly stiffen as I think up to a thought. \"What happened?\" I shoot up and stare into those kind eyes. I trust him to answer. \"Please, who are you? Where am I? Where\"s...Where\"s\"--I choke up, but the question is already on my tongue--\"Hoole?\" My talons clench as the name leaves me. At once, I see sympathy clearly written over their faces. A pang enters my heart. Sympathy for me? A nothing? \"Lutta.\" Sweet words again, and I suddenly wonder how this Barn Owl knows my name. \"It\"s hard to explain, but please...\" \"Listen carefully.\" Everyone, including me, jumps as the Great Gray speaks -- in a rather booming voice -- for the first time. The Elf Owl frowns at him. The older Barn Owl gives him a quick nudge. Words tumble from the young Barn Owl\"s beak. \"Lutta, we read about you in legends. It\"s been a long time since you were... \"Well, you\"re at the Great Ga\"Hoole Tree, and it\"s been a long time since you were...\" His voice dies down as he hesitates. \"Dead,\" the older Barn Owl finishes. He says it with that sympathy shown in his eyes. \"It\"s been thousands of years from your time, and we read about you from some legends about some...events...\" He clears his throat, determined to go on. \"Coryn here\"--a gesture at the young Barn Owl--\"is the king. I\"m his uncle, Soren. This is Gylfie\"--a gesture at the Elf Owl, who nods in greeting--\"Twilight,\" the Great Gray, \"and Digger\"--what a funny looking Burrowing Owl. \"My uncle and his friends are called the Band,\" Coryn adds. I let this newfound information seep in. Thousands of years? Could this be possible? I was dead, right? It\"s been so long -- and...I was dead? How...? \"I have a GIZZARD!\" \"You do not have a gizzard, you fool! you idiot! I created you.\" \"You created me, but I created this gizzard!\" \"No!\" What is this? \"Emerilla?\" He turns as I change. He knows now...what am I to do? Dismay spreads through my body. He\"ll probably think I\"m a freak too, and he\"ll hate me. But I love him! In the next second, I\"m flying at him. Adrenline floods me as I feel...am I losing myself? This gref... He\"ll hate me now. I slam into him, and he flies backward. \"I love you!\" I want to scream. I want to scream those three words. To let him understand. I want to scream, \"I love you!\" Then, an enexpected blow to the back of my head. Pain. Unexpected pain. Then talons, stopping me in my tracks. Talons...digging into me, slashing everywhere. My vision spins to red. I\"m being ripped apart at the seams. Torn. No... Why are you...? I sink, and I fall apart, literally. My feathers fall off, as my body becomes a lump of darkness. A lump of feathers. I truly am nothing... You\"d expect a real body when one is torn by claws -- and yet...feathers only. My phantom gizzard lurches. \"Half-hags!\" \"I had to kill her.\" WHY? \"She pretended to be my Emerilla.\" Is that all! I\"m going to die like this! Just because I was an imposter! \"I knew from the start that something was not right about her. A blood deception she was -- a hagsfiend.\" Anger -- hot, seeping rage enters me. And cold feelings. Feeling that make me want to shed tears. \"No!\" I manage. \"Who are you?\" Who? Hoole...you accept me as someone? Hoole... \"I am nothing...and yet, I loved...\" I loved... \"Lutta?\" \"Hey! Are you all right?\" \"What\"s wrong? Lutta!\" I sink down as my mind spins. Then, I black out. All was dark except for the fluttering movement of wings -- brown wings. A Barn Owl shifted in the branches of the magnificent tree, her dark eyes gleaming as she looked into the hollow. How strange that she could get so close to the tree so easily. She was but a sillhouette against the branched skies. She eyed the hollow, and the inhabitants. Her son...too bad she would have to kill him. He would have made a fine pure owl, had he not inherited his uncle\"s stupid softness. She could just kill him, right there and then. How easy, that everything she had been working for for the last few months would just be completed now, so easily. She could easily snatch the ember, then swoop in and kill Coryn, his disgraceful uncle, and get her dear mate\"s -- rest his soul -- revenge. Then, kill those pathetic owls that were always around Soren, and anyone else she comes across in the tree, just for a bonus. It would be wonderful to see their pained, stupefied faces as she sank her claws through their feathers, one by one. Then she saw the hagsfiend, and her eyes widened in horror. I am the last! How is this possible? Why is she in that hollow! She could just kill her as well -- but her eyes caught something, and her gizzard twitched. No...she\"ll just stay back and observe. This hagsfiend could prove some use to her and... Sadistic impulse shot through Nyra\"s gizzard. The adoring gleam in the hagsfiend\"s eye as she stared at Nyroc. No, she\"ll wait. Nyra silently spread her wings and swooped into the night sky. She had plotting to do. PT: Please, enjoy :) I hope I can fill up some holes in the story as soon as I can. Though, they\"re there for suspense. Please review! Nothing, Yet A Love Never Dying PT: THANKS SO MUCH FOR READING, EVERYONE!! Enjoy! I have a little more to say: I know the last book already came out, and I\"ve finished it already. I\"m a little stunned, but in courtesy of those who have not yet finished it, I won\"t spoil it. However, despite the end, I\"m continuing the fic the way it is. I\"ve just noticed how much I\"ve been neglecting the story O.o Anyways, I was rather...displeased with a few stories stuck in the GoGH fandom, and while I was planning to leave it after finishing this fic, I might a few more fics for this. Not that I have hubris...I just...don\"t know...I just think I\"ll contribute to the fandom with a few fics of angst :D Anani Mouse Thank you, thank you so much :D -Head swells- Frosted Fate Yeah, poor Lutta D: Wish Hoole ended up with her. One of the Populace Oh...-sobs- Hi! :D FlamingSerpent Thanks! I\"m flattered x) True, Nyra\"s so important to the plot -- being sadistic and plotting revenge, among other things :) Hawkrain I\"m glad you\"re eager :D Thanks for reviewing and liking it! :) Lara-Van Thank you, thank you -bows- X) It\"s great that you think that; cheered me right up ;) The Great Tree I can make them hurt... My Mum and Da. I can make them feel the pain that they\"ve put on me. They can hurt, and I\"d be able to do it to them. A change in our positions is want I want so badly, and they\"d taste the bile they stuck in my throat. They left me...they left me, their chick Lutta. Theirs. I have the power now -- to make them hurt. I can make them hurt. I can make them hurt... \"Lutta!\" Stop slapping me. \"Lutta, wake up!\" Slap. Stop slapping me with your wing, it stings. Slap. Slap. \"WAKE UP, Lutta.\" Slap. Slap. Stop it! I\"m trying to-- \"Lutta, please!\" ...Hoole? Hoole\"s voice! I flick my eyelids open -- all four of them -- at the same time. Hoole? No, it\"s Coryn. Just Coryn. \"Lutta, are you all right?\" The way he looks at me...it\"s like Hoole. So much like Hoole. \"I\"m fine,\" I answer, and immediately scan my surroundings. Perhaps I have become overly paranoid with time, but I can\"t be sure. In any case, I can\"t let my guard down in this case; I could find myself dead in a second, just like that I died in an instant -- killed by Strix Strumajen. I shudder, remembering the memory of being ripped. Ripping, ripping, tearing, blood, pain-- Death. And then... Well, I don\"t want to think about what I don\"t remember. After that, there was nothing but a cluster of memories of what happened within death-- Falling. Falling... Floating...unraveling...flowing through the winds...becoming one with nature...then falling.... Falling, falling downwards, a curse uttered upon my kind: \"To hagsmire.\" Hagsmire, where the ones who have sinned within their lives went, for eternal damnation. Hagsmire, for hagsfiends, and...and... Nothings. Nothings -- they who mean nothing to the world, who should never have entered this life, this realm of breathing. Falling, agony, curses, darkness, cold hate. Those flaws of what life and death decide. And nothings. Nothings, like me. Nothing. Snap out of it. I don\"t want to remember. Of being one of the damned. And now I\"m back. Why? \"Lutta?\" -- and I look up. Hoole -- no, Coryn. Coryn, the Barn Owl. Unconsciously, I stare at him with huge eyes that deserve to pop out of their sockets. \"Yes?\" I say. Oh Coryn, please don\"t look at me like that. You look like Hoole, please, don\"t look sympathic...please don\"t...I want it but you don\"t have to give it. Can you not see that my heart has already been broken? \"Lutta,\" he says, softly, and gives me a tender nudge with his wing. \"Can you stand?\" I nod, because I cannot find myself shaking my head. \"Yes.\" Can my legs work? He steps back slightly, to give me room, and I try to remember how to use legs again. Now, I just...position them...and push upwards... A searing pain. My legs! They hurt! They hurt! Fall down again -- No, I can\"t. I can\"t fall; I\"ve told Coryn that I will stand, will be able, and I will not lie; not anymore; I have already lied and tricked Hoole, I will not do so again, not to any owl. Nor this owl. This owl, who stares with the eyes of a true king. A young king, but a wise one, and a good one. With difficulty, I stagger forward, out of the small nest. I feel the bark underneath my claws as I step on it; bark again, how it brings back thoughts of those days. It feels a bit unfamiliar, but I cannot forget bark. Such a thing is pathetic. I feel my legs quivering, wanting to give way, but no. No. I have said that I will stand. How they quiver! -- stop it. Stop quivering! I have said I will walk, and I will walk, even if this pain continues -- like fire searing at me, numbing in a way. I will not lie again. Deception has torn me once before; never again. I look at Coryn, see the concern in his eyes; he hesitates to step forward, wanting to help. No, I can do it. Please. Let me. I walk, a little faster, wanting my legs to stride. They work, a little better. I look at Coryn again, and I ask, \"Where am I?\" \"The Great Ga\"Hoole Tree.\" Silence. My breathe hitches quickly. \"The...\" I pause, mind spinning and reeling. The Tree? The Great Ga\"Hoole Tree, that was reigned over by...Hoole? \"Tree?\" The Tree. The Great Ga\"Hoole Tree. And my mind explodes. \"Th -- Then!\" I jump as I begin stuttering. \"The Ga\"Hoole Tree! I -- I don\"t belong here! I am nothing! I lo-- \"Hoole, he...NO! I am a disgrace! My presence is dirtying this tree!\" I back away, seeking some sort of exit. I don\"t belong here. No. I am defiling the Tree. How long has it been since the last time I was here? I deceived the good king, I nearly killed him -- he was a great king, and a great owl! I don\"t deserve to be here! How many good owls reside in this tree now, the Tree that was grown by -- as rumor says -- the sorrow and goodness of Hoole? I don\"t belong here! Coryn jumps now. Please, no! \"Lutta!\" he says, eyes flashing with some sort of fire that started. \"You are not!\" Not? But...Hoole! Hoole! -- please no! You--! I stare, transfixed, as I see Coryn change. I don\"t see Coryn anymore. I see...you. Hoole. Eyes, eyes that spoke of what you believed in. Your sense of love for those close to you, your fiery will that would see indiscrimation to the very end. I\"m sorry Hoole! I deceived you! I am everything you are not! -- and should not be! I am NOTHING! I back away, seeing Hoole. He steps forward, that look in his eyes-- \"You deserve to be here! You--\" I stumble backwards as I shriek, \"Hoole! Don\"t! Don\"t you understand!\" Now is my time to confess! I never told him that I was-- I\"m sorry Hoole. I\"m so sorry! \"Lutta!\" The owl before me is -- He\"s pleading! No, I don\"t deserve it! \"Lutta, you do! Just as any owl!\" My gizzard throbs, beating against its surroundings. I stare upwards, feeling it grow cold. \"NO! I DON\"T DESERVE TO BE HERE! I AM NOTHING! I -- DO -- NOT -- BELONG -- HERE! I AM...\" My gizzard gives a jerk. My throat fills with pebbles; \"Nothing....\" My words are choked. It\"s true. I am nothing. I don\"t deserve to be here, at the Great Tree. PT: Like? Hate? Please review. I hope to update soon. Fill up the plot holes, twist the story...you know. Nothing, Yet A Love Never Dying PT: I really need to update more often. xD -Shot- ...-looks out window- Well, I thought I\"d take some advantage. Now that I\"m in high school, and in the JROTC program, I\"ve joined the drill team that saps up all the members\" time. But as of this month practice has been cancelled until further notice. Now I have the energy and time for writing, so yeah -shrugs- FlamingSerpent I know, right? So sad...last book...oh the nostalgia.... PokemonKnight Yes, isn\"t that talent just so impressive? x) -shot- Thank you. silverrosetail Thank you, and thanks for the further information ^^ Hopefully, once this is pointed out, things will definitely unfold a little more. SamPD Mmhm...since I\"ve already replied to you... Crazydragonlord Thank you~! n_n I appreciate that. Move Again, Step By Step Nyra glanced down at the small bit of parchment in her right claw, squinting slightly to make out the ancient words. The Kraakish scrawled upon it was old, but young enough for her to translate. The general of the Pure Ones had to stop the glee that was bubbling upwards in her gizzard -- no, not yet, when this isn\"t confirmed to work -- but she allowed herself to flush slightly with success. For the sake of her sanity and her own feelings of encouragement. Success was near... Nearing... ...Bit -- by -- bit. \"Yes.\" A glint came to concentrated eyes. \"This is it.\" I look up. Consciousness is drifting back with a comforting steadiness. It comes kindly, but firmly. But I let it come. Hell. My body aches -- all of it, it aches and hurts and pinches itself. It\"s a twisted rag -- I\"m a twisted rag. Hoole. Coryn. Oh... I shouldn\"t be here. The thought is fire, or else ice. I shouldn\"t be here. I don\"t deserve to be here. My thoughts are taking flight from where they have left off. I don\"t deserve to be here. Of course I don\"t. I look around as my vision clears; he is not here...Coryn, was it? No one is here. My phantom gizzard -- phantom, yes... -- speaks...it sends a jolt of alarm. Warning. They have left me. They must have. Kind as they seemed to be, they must have left me here...in this hollow...perhaps wanting me to leave on my own, too disgusted to act. A saddening thought. They acknowledged me, though, and they were kind. Perhaps they saw through to something... But that\"s reality, is it not? -- of course, freak that I am; player of the confidant game that I am...an actor, nothing more. There is no real me. My grief has quieted. I should leave then -- it cracks my phantom gizzard in half -- this is the tree; and I am nothing. I shall leave then...go somewhere else to rot, quietly, for the peace. This tree has something...something...that revives Hoole\"s life. I wonder, then...if he is looking down here. I wonder what he is thinking. At least he is at peace. There is no me to disturb him, and I shall bother him no more in this tree. Hoole. I am sorry. I don\"t deserve any of your love. And I will not bother Coryn. He reminds me so much of you. I turn to face the opening of the hollow, veiled by lichen. Pretty. How alive. There is air outside; nighttime seeps through the fleshy fibers. Cool air, and a wide expanse. Shall I fly till the end of my miserable days? I shift; I can move. Then I can leave. There is no reason to stay here, of course...this is Hoole\"s home; I shall not taint it. Oh, it\"s silent -- I can\"t believe it took so long for me to notice it; my feathers are rustling -- I must look ugly -- and my feet shift. I can move. This is life. I am alive. Truly, truly alive. I cannot tell what exact state I am in, but I know I must be a mess. But outside I can release, can I not? Release, and perhaps become one with nature, earth or sky. There is a whole world out there, limitless. I can wander till the end of my days, past even the confinements of the land we owls know. Beyond the beyond the beyond. I fear no danger; in fact, the danger can come, and I shall not care if it kills me. I am an owl -- whatever I am -- with nothing to lose and nothing to gain. Then I am ready. I listen one more time, pause, before beginning the endless journey. Nothing. There is nothing but the hum of silence, scratching in cadence. I must be desperate to stay, as if I truly deserve it. I don\"t. I cannot stop thinking about this; I deserve nothing. I am nothing, after all. If I am damned to this line of reality for this whole retake at life, then so be it. Then, I will take my leave. Good riddance, then. My eyes mist. When I shake my head to clear the fog, I hop forward -- painful -- and I manage to walk. I can do this. There is the opening; I will go now. I must be cherishing the whisper of lush wind. I will go. I will go. With a shake of my ruffled feathers, I jump out, brush through the lichen that caresses my wings in farewell -- with pity? -- and snap my wings open. A prickling sensation. With a quick look downwards, as the world rushes in, I see the silver-gray plumage restored to my chest. A shapeshifter again. Coryn watched the candle before him splutter wetly, in its final throes of death. Though fire was life, it needed something to last. Something that helped it, hurled it onward. Without, it would die, die and scream. Then it would fall silent and blow out of existence. And that would be that. Died, and was dead. But undoubtedly, irrevocably, dead. How, then...how? -- how did a dead owl, undoubtedly gone for years upon years upon years...how could a dead owl rise, fresh and breathing, from the dead? This was illogical, and beyond the illogical itself. Of course there could be attempts to raise the dead, but...the body. And the sheer closeness to impossibility. Lutta, the owl of legend, was alive after being dead for so long. How...? Her body must have withered and become nothing but food for the earth to devour greedily. Though the beyond of the horizon of the logical was boundless, this was still... How, he mused. How. That was what he was pursuing. How? How? How? How had she returned to the earth? Was she an illusion? -- if so, she was something beyond illusion...she was too perfect to be something to be called a mere illusion. Coryn mused onward as he turned back to the sheafs of paper -- he had left Lutta for the pursuit of something...something that could shed its light upon the happenings. So long ago. Lutta. Was this a work of nachtmagen? There was that possibility, faded as the yellow craft was. Then who had performed it? Coryn could not grab it; he snatched at empty air. There was nothing to tell him. Nothing that anything could tell him, nor aid him. This was an enigma beyond most anagrams of matters. This was a mess. He had found her, Lutta, merely lying on some branch of the tree. And, through some urging of the gizzard, he had brought her back into the tree itself. This made little sense. He dived into another pool of thoughts. What if...? There was a bang; he jumped and turned. There was a curse of \"raccdrops!\" Twilight. Coryn called, one wing still laid flat over a book, \"What\"s going on?\" More cursing, followed by Gylfie\"s reprimands. There was a loud whirlwind of a flutter, and soon the whole Band was within the room! \"What?\" Coryn said loudly at the undignified relative of a heap before him. \"What\"s happened?\" Something shot through his gizzard. Soren spoke first, in a rushed but determined voice. \"She\"s gone!\" Another shot. Something like cold fear and wonder. \"She\"s gone!\" Gylfie wailed. \"Lutta\"s gone!\"", "\"All will become one with Russia,\" he said, almost simply, his cheer eerie. Fists were already clenched; now they groped about, for a pan, a rifle, a sword-there was nothing. In some way, this brought her but a sigh of relief-Gilbert and Roderich, she was reminded, were not here to suffer as well. If Ivan put his giant hands on Roderich... Click, went an object, and Elizaveta was snapped into the world when her own instincts pulled her head away; on time, for Ivan\"s collar was soon found to be touching the tip of her nose: she went cross-eyed staring at the thing: it pinched her skin, now red with anger. How dare you- Oppression! No one could lay that yoke above her again!-she would never allow it! Even when a sort of purple shroud seemed to wrap itself about Ivan and blaze as a fire would...even as a faint eerie \"kolkolkol\" was thick in the air...Elizaveta held her ground-glaring, hating, repulsing. Oppression. No more oppression...! His eyes dropped; his hand followed: with a bolt of alarm-lechery?-feint?-Elizaveta took one step back, bristling as the wolf does. Watching the muscles of the Russian arms twitch, she ducked when he snatched at where her waist would have been had she remained still; with a quick flush of indignation, she glared upward; if only Ludwig had not been forced out! He had retreated with such haste, back to Berlin, offering to bring her with him, though knowing that she would not leave-Hungary was her, and her place. So he had left, alone and resigned to the fact that even Veneziano had to leave him, taken by the Allies. Elizaveta had watched him go with as much resignation. Endsieg, the Germans called it. Ivan was huge, behemoth above an ant...no, not an ant, but perhaps a lotus...perhaps a hybrid of that with a rose. There is no rose without thorns, after all. The Soviets had already been merciless, ruthless as the next army: the ache of rape and massacre fluttered about the land. If anything, the nation itself would fight. Useless as it was. Ivan dropped the collar. Still galvanizing with mental shocks down the spine, she watched closely. Too closely. Ivan\"s hand dove downwards and snatched. With a horrified she jumped back, giving a swift right hook to his neck, the closest she could reach. -And in the end, it almost didn\"t matter. Ivan smiled triumphantly as a long-forgotten weight was shifted from her belt. With a savage look from one of him and Elizaveta, the paper was in between his fingers...Elizaveta looked, stunned-in the moment it felt as if the appendix had been removed from her body. As useless yet familiar thing was there, the memory of its origins...filled with not blood, but gore-milk skin against the universe of deadness. The paper was scrolled about the Russian\"s fingers; somehow, it completed the image-a bloody Soviet, grinning wickedly as the royal purple billowed from his eyes: to top it all off, a dirty cream paper twisted about his raised digits. It was almost gray. She had long since forgotten about the thing; the small text, written in Gilbert\"s-a frantic parry-handwriting; out fell a finger, and it was the one from the bombed wreck. Just its weight-it had been there all along, useless, a little keepsake of Berlin; what she had seen there. What she had left behind for her own Hungarian version. It was white still, yet shriveled, and dry-that was all; it had changed, though not enough. \"German,\" Ivan said, warmly-no, coldly...swelteringly icy, and that was oxymoronic, but oxymoronic was practically the composure of him...him, all him. \"This is a finger from Germany, da?\" \"How do you...\" She sucked in a breath; refused to let her eyes widen. The grin widened; \"Just a lucky guess.\" He giggled, sickeningly, violet mist shrouding the remains of his person; his teeth were a white and perfect-they flashed in the buttercup sun, which laid its yellow upon the stiff white ground, touched with chill. Elizaveta stood stock-still then: she did the whole time; something had been torn away, and it lay resting among Ivan\"s grubby fingers, clad in leather-worn leather gloves that anyone would wear these days...she rubbed at her own, slightly shredded, at the still-clothed fingertips. Hands-they were worn down: hers and Ivan\"s. Beaten flesh. Looking up again, relief flashed briefly, the white light stark against her crimson crumbling heart, or else the mind-one was meaningful as the other; with that thought, of Roderich, Gilbert, Ludwig, Veneziano, and the war as a human, Ares... Endsieg. There was nothing to lose, but more lives. Eyeing the Russians, who had swept her land into scorched blood, she charged. There was nothing more to lose, and she kept on telling herself that. Even as the Soviets rushed over, rustling the paper with the breeze stirred by their boots; even as she lay ready to die, ready to live, tired as a nation at the end of his time. There was plenty of dust, and plenty of blood, and her body ached. It fit-it all fit. The yoke had been laid over her shoulders-the niggling thought that it was cracked brought no satisfaction: the Soviets still had claim laid over the land fought so hard for: Everything I\"ve done, she thought, as a cough formed within her throat, was for my people. Her thoughts flickered, at Roderich, at Gilbert-if she could not fight, she could marry, or give herself over; but she could fight, she merely needed the mentality rather than the plentiful physique: that was why she was in...this. \"Fuck,\" she breathed, eyes shut against the world. The last soldier soon disappeared through the limits of sound; peace and dust remained-not one stray man was left, no one else to strap the lead to her bones. Limbs aching, heart aching, mind aching, she lay there among the debris- No wonder, then, said the idle mind; she could have scowled, but it would have hurt too much-coughing did not help: if it stayed, it hurt the throat; if it was released, it cut the throat; the effort of checking it racked the whole body, and there was none of it anyway. Head lolling back, Elizaveta felt the paper, the finger, lying dead on the ground: Russia had dropped it, mockingly, to replace the grave flowers. There were no flowers, aside from those withered things in her hair. They were papery. Still, being near dead...the well of strength was dry. There was but moisture left in the moss growing upon the clammy stone-up the frozen cylinder it traveled, and so she flinched when the hand came. It was cold. Cold-and yet, hot as ice-white and freezing; the touch was familiar. It was light as a feather. The feather was upon the shoulder; it pressed, though not harshly; still, it could not be described as gentle. The hand was frail as her strength-brittle and cold and old. She refused to open her eyes then. She had decided, some time ago, that she liked the dark. She preferred it; it was friendly, and it allowed ignorance to be an excuse. It was kind, and she wished it could be a closer friend. But white-why white... \"Hey,\" said something, someone, something, someone. The ax scraped against the stone; it rasped with a familiar tinge of the past months, which were long as eternity, significant as the rest of time\"s children. It was a beautifully ugly voice, salty, bloody, white as fire. In the next moment there was nothing but one thing-it could not be. The pressure increased, it was beginning to hurt. Not able to growl, Elizaveta shifted with painful instinct-another cough ripped through her chest. \"Hey,\" said something again, and she summoned what was left of the moisture in the moss to flick her eyes open-it hurt: her eyes stung in white with water, but she knew it would come to pass. Everything comes to pass. Everything-absolutely everything: she had to keep on telling herself that, for though it passed, it took its very sweet time doing so; so that she could almost taste the bitter sparks on her tongue; it was parched, and thus drier. Spice. \"Fuck you,\" she whistled through her throat. It stung. It could not be. The pressure increased, not unexpectedly; it squeezed upon her shoulder, and it took a large muster of strength to finally blink the fluids away from the eyes, so that they were a clear green again-the first sight was white, as it always was-the second blink brought the sight of red, and some part of her-somewhere, deep down or hidden-despaired: agony nudged at her again, and she knew that those papers would not have been so kind as to let her go: no, she had to confront; it was a gift of something...that would not irk her for the rest of eternity, and yet a curse of more pain. The choice of selfishness or selflessness, when both loosed their boundaries and came together. And that hurt. More than anything, that hurt-the scorch of disappointment; denial, anxiety, fear-there was too much of it. And yet, she did not want him dead. It had taken her time, so much time to realize that...but she did not wish death upon anyone, having seen too much of it as the clock ticked away-she had never wanted anyone to truly die. Gilbert Beilschmidt, though she hated him above all, was no exception. But in times such as now, when war tore the world apart-when history decided to twist itself about-when the nations crumbled-how could death not be a blessing?-at this point she could almost want them all to be dead. Roderich, Gilbert, Veneziano, Ludwig...and yet she would watch with relief on the day that each of them would pick themselves up, and charge into the distance with life. She hated war. She blinked rapidly, staring, always watching; though she ached, she let the next batter of coughing come to pass-shock, it overcame her then. Charging upward, body screaming in protest, she could only slap him with strength that came by habit, before wrapping both arms around him, wondering how and why in hell- \"Get off me, woman!\" he protested, attempting to flail; she saw now that the tin had been stripped away, or at least most of it, as she felt him, flesh and cloth and hair-from the unhealthy pallor of his skin, from the dried hard uniform, to the pinked and browned hair, silver still shining boldly beneath the blood. He was unusually warm-hot even-when she felt him; clearly the cold had been warded off, though his hands still felt like ice; remembering the documents found in Ludwig\"s office, she realized that it was fever. But his head-feeling about the neck, she knew it was there-desperately feeling, just to know how cruel death was, she felt it, finding no seam-with a thin cry of joy and pain she kissed it, squeezing him till he was strangled- \"You\"re alive,\" she breathed, even as garbled speech flew from his lips. She was going into spasms-this was too unreal! And yet it was. He was so, so solid. His eyes were ruby. No petty pink glaze upon the Kingdom of Prussia\"s gaze-no death frosting them over. Clinging to him, something told her that she would never let go-a stupid little piece of wishful thought, no doubt: never let go, how ridiculous; and yet she did not release him, as he calmed between her limbs, resigning with guilty pleasure, rigid with denial. She could not even loosen about him-there was nothing but the jail scene playing and replaying itself in her mind-letting their hands drop, parting, and then the sickening sound of the guillotine\"s strike. Water, red, pink, silver, white, black. The swastika rose over all, as if to mock... \"Where in Isten\"s name have you been?\" she muttered against his shoulder, before lifting her head away hastily; still, though, she did not let go; she wanted to savor it. As the vampire feasts on blood. The scent of metal clung to him. \"Get off,\" was the obstinate reply; she lifted her hand and slapped him again, not knowing what else to do. \"Ow!\" \"Where\"ve you been?\" she said again. \"You were supposed to be dead-\" \"Well, I\"m so freaking not-\" \"I saw your head!\" she said, voice reaching a higher octave. \"It was a fake!\" \"Impossible,\" she declared, eyes widening before she finished; it came to her, suddenly-the way it had fallen, the sudden hush of death, the blindfold of stars, the blood-she had seen it, touched it, waded in the water it buried itself in.... She had suffered with him at death. \"You were dead...,\" she whispered; it gave way to coughing, and he only watched as she did; held onto her and she held onto him. \"I heard the thud. If you were dead-\" He grunted. When she looked up, his eyes were a bitter red. \"The head was fake. They...held me down.\" Scowling, he looked away; admittance was ignominy. \"They held me down up there. There were lots of them, Hungary-scheiße, there was a lot of back-up that we didn\"t notice; I couldn\"t beat off all of them. And my gun ran out...\" His voice faded; still, his scowl deepened, and he finished to his own satisfaction. \"Their leader was fun to kill though.\" He laughed, cruelly, forcefully-he found no love for death, though he had seen enough of it to mind less. Elizaveta decided against shaking her head-it could only be true; she had known him for years, since they were incomplete nations, just children running about with swords of both wood and steel. Just as he had sifted out her identity from that of Elisabeth Wertheim\"s, it was with ease that she found that this man in front of her was real: as nations in human form, they were allowed the same detached senses as those immortal. Stupid, she scolded herself, knowing not to trust so easily; but it was what it was. She noticed the shards of tin still upon his flesh then-of course, he could not have been thrown out so easily-time was needed, so much time; some things did not change, but could. They trapped him. Shackled his person. Still not releasing-he was too real, too solid, to let go-she let the glimpses of his uniform and body form in her mind; she looked about, saw the blood, the bruises, the sickly pallor of his skin. Dread formed with it, in a way almost instinctive, be it Gilbert or not: \"What did they do to you.\" It was not a question-it was an exclamation, asking, wondering, but not questioning. The papers came to mind again. A pause-it was too long, in Elizaveta\"s mind. With a ferociousness that came at will, that sapped her meager strength as well as supplied it, she asked, this time, demanded, \"What did they do to you?\" He was biting his lips, not speaking; still, obstinately, she took him by the shoulders again, harder, saying, \"What did they do to you?\" The papers came to mind again...how Ludwig had admitted it, how Gilbert had been so emotionless for the past year.... A protectiveness that she had never felt before, for but Roderich and Veneziano, but never this man, emerged; it reared its head menacingly-some maternal side of her glared outwards, and she shook him. \"Tell me!\" He only bit his lips harder. \"Tell me, God damn it,\" she said. \"I found documents in Ludwig\"s office. Is it true...\" he looked at her \"...that, throughout the war....\" \"Ja,\" he said, finally; his tone shook at the slightest, but was steely at the same time. His eyes grew hard. Elizaveta had never seen him like this, before the war-so close to tiredness, so close to a sort of trauma; he spread trauma, he did not suffer from it. She had known him for so long, and yet finally.... Not noticing how hard she was holding onto him, as if to crush him, she leaned in with complete urgency, green pools of eyes reflecting the cracked image of Gilbert Beilschmidt. \"Russia...hurt my people. So much.\" He snorted softly, in disgust. \"And der Führer\"-derision-\"doesn\"t like me a lot.\" The line along his brows became harsh, harsher than they needed to be. \"My people aren\"t West\"s. They\"re different. And they don\"t like der fucking Führer. \"West didn\"t know; he only knew later, but they told him I was dead. He was pissed and everything; he lost my awesomeness after all.\" The grin curled along his chapped lips. There was no humor in it. \"I\"m just a small state now; I\"m the most freaking awesome state that existed, but I\"m still just a state. \"They experimented on me,\" he continued; Elizaveta could see the anger etched along his face, and she felt it too; she had suffered, though not as much, by the way it sounded-her Jews were still her people, no matter what the Germans said. She could never understand why others could do this to people.... \"Russia\"s people and West\"s people. They raped the women and killed the children.\" A shudder passed through him, in painful memory; again, Elizaveta noted his love as a nation for his people; Prussian, Crusader, Knight he may be, he still had people. \"Well, mostly Russia\"s. West\"s did too, but mostly they just did those experiments and sent them off to work.\" Another sour laugh. \"Hitler thought I wasn\"t really important later on-before that he just sat around glaring and all. I had to go to jail several times-they said I was encouraging sedition against him, and that\"s when it happened.\" \"They...\" Elizaveta spoke at last. \"Torture,\" he said, nodding coolly. \"Later Hitler started doing it outright-he thought that I wasn\"t good enough, and didn\"t deserve his shithole of a Reich. What a failure,\" he added darkly. She scowled at him, alarmed, angered, bewildered; \"Why didn\"t you tell Ludwig?\" \"And what would he have done?\" he answered cuttingly. \"Kicked him off and told the Allies and Jews that he was sorry?-West\"s a stubborn arschloch, and he loves his Führer so much.\" \"Oh Gilbert...,\" was all she could say, and she could only blink aside from that. \"Was?\" he snapped, silver locks bouncing. \"Is this why...\" \"Ja. Haven\"t you noticed that this Gott-forsaken war is tearing the world apart?\" \"I have,\" she said quietly, not protesting; his statement was horribly obvious. \"I don\"t think it\"d be easy to miss.\" Now it was her turn to smile, so she did; it was bitter as his, and the worn grinning soldiers were twins. She sucked in a breath before wheezing at the slightest; the image shattered. \"And,\" he added, though almost hastily, \"I\"ve always wanted to know\"-she looked at him, albeit with some anxiety for the topic-\"what in hell do you see in Roderich?\" She should\"ve slapped him. She should\"ve pummeled him into the ground. She should\"ve left him then and there. She should\"ve. She could\"ve. In the end she did not. She saw it coming. She knew it had to-it was bound to, heading her way; the circumstances catapulted them at her; the tension crackling in the air, like electricity powered it-I should have come sooner, but now...she had never been able to measure the distance from whence it came. Now it was laid before, and she wondered why this exchange had never occurred between them-they were too busy fighting. Hating each other. And she still hated him, but they had enough now, to ceasefire for the moment. Enough of what, she could not say. Roderich. How could she tell him...as she stared wistfully at Gilbert\"s crimson eyes, some part of her wished that she had never met him, nor Roderich-if only one should be nothing to her, she would be happy; he would be happy-no tumbling love, no turmoil with the blood split between them. If she had only grown up to be a boy after all; if only it would be when she was still the wild girl on the plains (not that she would ever miss Mongolia, Turkey, or having to carry a bow and arrows out with her from so young an age...), beating Roderich-Austria-back till he could not even move; even before Gilbert began to defend her land. But no. In the end she had met someone so kind, someone who had given her love in a hate-filled life; someone who gave her a second glance, and more, not in hostility or for the sake of land-he was fortunate Austria, who valued peace. Perfection did not exist-but to Elizaveta, he was the closest to achieving it; never had anyone been so positively unreal. She loved him. She could trust him. Gilbert had been hell-sent. He had made fun of all the trials of her life-hurt Roderich...was a barbarian who cared for none for himself; there was nothing but power, and all who even stumbled in his path were gleefully slaughtered. Studying his face now, she could see the years imprinted upon his face; the stupid boy, the hateful man, dishonorable dog he was. And yet-in the end, she had been proven wrong about his care: he loved Ludwig. His people. In some way, there were binds tying them together. If not loved, then cared for; in the end, he was proven to be human, if not a ruthless one. In the end, however...they were both merely tired nations, one about to drop dead; it was painful to think of. Had she fallen in love with this man? This man...who was merely one step away from even raping Roderich-she had thought it so when he came back speaking of lost Silesia, though she had been quick in recalling the pious side of her Prussian foe-could she have fallen in love? It was not impossible to love two-and it was only now that she thought it, thought hard. Unthinkable! she snapped. She proved herself wrong when she put their mouths together. \"Roderich is better than you,\" she hissed through their teeth; his lips were cold, pale, chapped; chapped and cold as hers. He was complying coolly, almost thoughtfully. \"You may have claimed my vital regions first\"-they smirked in unison-\"but my heart is still Austrian territory.\" She then muttered against his tongue all that she thought, of him, of Roderich-of Roderich\"s kindness and heaven-sent presence, of Gilbert\"s disgusting being. They were all true, they both knew; but hate and love were married in a balanced union: thus she hated him, and did not all at once."]}
{"id": "ae9297e9-2ae5-5e3f-a2ab-ef7c322f2647", "fandoms": ["Hocus Pocus", "Boondock Saints"], "pair": ["\"Told you.\" Jay walked over to the group of sitting people in the middle of the room. \"Alright, so what are we gonna do here, man? I mean, you\"ve gotta have like a... like a plan or something!\" \"There weren\"t that many zombies gathering outside my house in Los Angeles.\" Max retorted. \"Well we can\"t just stay in here with those freaky witches, dude!\" On the second floor they heard Winifred curse and stomp, shaking dust from the ceiling down onto Jay\"s head and causing him to cough once more. Max began to put his old pair of shoes on that he\"d taken from Ice, which the larger teenager noticed. \"Hey!\" Max finished tying the shoes and tossed him the used pair he\"d been wearing during the night. \"Alright, then we just wait here until they go away, right?\" Jay asked. \"We can\"t do that, who knows how long they\"ll wait outside for us?\" Binx responded. Jay stared at him wide-eyed before looking at various faces. \"Did that cat just talk man?\" \"Calm down, we can\"t think if you won\"t stop talking.\" Max told them. \"I\"m kind of freaked out, alright?\" \"We all are; first the witches and now this... but we need to think about this; arguing won\"t accomplish anything.\" Allison spoke, trying to diffuse the situation. Jay turned around and walked away, once again running his hands through his hair as he paced back and forth. \"And I thought we were scared.\" Dani muttered. Suddenly Jay came to a stop and spun around, facing back towards the group. \"Wait, I\"ve got it; there\"s this guy I know, kind of crazy, but he\"s totally hooked up with guns and stuff. He used to be in the military but he got kicked out. He\"s one of those conspiracy dudes. He\"d know what to do.\" \"What are you, kidding? We\"re not going to just stroll across town to put our lives in the hands of some creepy psycho. Even if it was a good idea, we can\"t get out of the house.\" Jay\"s temporary optimism vanished and he shook his head, thinking again despite how hard it probably was for him to do so. \"If only we had some kind of clue; something to help us think of a way out of this.\" Max thought out loud. All of a sudden there was a loud crunch as part of the first floor ceiling gave way and Sarah\"s legs fell through the hole in the aged floorboards. \"Watch where you walk, you dolt!\" Winifred scolded the youngest sister. Her bare legs kicked about beneath the dress she wore, her untied shoes somehow staying on. Jay and Ice began drifting towards the area beneath the hole, but Sarah was pulled up out of it before they could get a peak at anything else. Allison rolled her eyes at the behavior as Max said \"That wasn\"t exactly what I had in mind.\" However, a few moments later Allison moved forward in her chair, thinking. \"Wait, this house is really old, right?\" Max shrugged and said he thought so even though she was merely making a statement. \"Lots of these old houses were mills in the wilderness. During the winter they didn\"t want to have to go out to a storage shed to get supplies so they built storage spaces beneath their houses. Sometimes they even had short escape tunnels in case the house caught on fire.\" Jay and Ice immediately started searching for anything that looked like a panel or hatch, soon the others joined in on the search. Eventually they discovered a floorboard that was much larger than the others beneath a bookcase and decided they would have to move it. \"Should we tell the witches about this?\" Allison whispered. They glanced back at the staircase. \"They do still likely want to use the potion to take the life force from children.\" Binx offered. \"Besides, dying as a result of their time running out will probably be less painful than being eaten.\" Max added. \"Well, well, it seems our stout right heroes have brewed a bit of deceit themselves.\" A voice chided them from the top of the staircase. Winifred descended the steps, her sisters right behind her. \"Thou art not as good and pure as thee thought. No matter; I will leave you to scurry through your burrows... sisters!\" At Winifred\"s command her younger siblings veered off, Sarah grabbing their brooms and Mary drew aside the wooden block in front of the door. \"But scurry quickly, lest ye become a ghastly ghoul\"s delicious dinner!\" She grabbed the most appropriate broom from Sarah\"s hands and opened the door of the house, zapping the nearest zombie with electricity before flying off into the night. Mary followed shortly thereafter on a vacuum cleaner. The adolescents\" attention was drawn towards the cauldron as they heard a \"plunk\" sound, and Sarah finished sealing some of the potion in a vial before scampering to the door and flying off on a mop. The group shouted after them but had little time to dwell on the witches\" selfless departure as the zombies could now enter the house. Max called for Jay\"s and Ice\"s help in pushing the bookcase out of the way and, with some effort and kicked up dust, they managed to pull the heavy bookcase aside. Allison was instantly down on the floor and wiped away the dust near the revealed hatch\"s handle before smiling in relief and pulling it up. Hers, and everyone else\"s hope was extinguished, however, when they discovered that the passageway in which they intended to escape had caved in long ago. The mound of dirt that had buried their dreams symbolized their coming demise. Maybe the sisters had known about it and that was why they had not tried to use it earlier, or perhaps they had been unaware of it altogether. Regardless, those that remained in the house were left with a horde of flesh-hungry zombies to contend with and no escape. \"Come on, we need to close the door!\" Max called while running towards the exit. But he was stopped as Binx told him \"No! This may very well be the chance we\"ve needed. The zombies are focused on where the sisters went after they flew off, and they\"re slow. If we run we may very well be able to avoid them. It\"s a blessing in disguise.\" \"What are you, crazy cat? I\"m not going to play running back against a mob of zombies!\" Ice argued. \"We either run or we lock ourselves in here and wait until they break through the door. And my name is not \"crazy cat\" it is Binx.\" They stood, deciding in silence. Eventually Max realized they didn\"t have time. \"Binx is right; we need to get out of here while we can.\" Dani nodded, saying she was going to go wherever he went. \"Allison, what do you think?\" The girl asked. The teenager in question rose from the floor and nodded her approval before they all gathered near the door. \"All right, ready?\" Binx asked. Though the answers weren\"t all agreeable, the consensus was made and they decided to regroup near the truck. They dashed out from the house, winding and weaving their ways around the zombies they encountered. At times they were mere inches from the ghouls\" snapping teeth, but they quickly made their way towards the truck and Max leapt into the driver\"s seat as Dani, Allison and Binx got inside as well. Jay and Ice were trailing behind, having had to double back and with a gathering group of zombies chasing after them. \"Where are we supposed to go, man?\" Jay shouted as they sprinted towards the truck. Max pushed the car door open and leaned out to tell them to get in the bed of the truck. However, he had barely finished speaking before an unseen zombie tore him from the truck and threw him to the ground, grabbing at him in the dirt. Max shouted in fear and kicked at the monster as it grasped at his jeans but was unable to keep the creature from dragging its way up his legs. The dirty, cracked fingernails reached for his face as the undead ghoul\"s teeth snapped at him. It lurched forward; its teeth aimed at his neck, before it jolted to a stop and was pulled back down the teenager by Jay and Ice. They helped him up and he thanked them for the assistance as Dani shouted his name. The rotting smell of death fell upon them as a zombie seemed to materialize out of nowhere, and bit Jay on the shoulder. Max jumped forward and pushed the zombie from the young man before getting in the truck and telling them to get in the back once more. They eagerly complied and as Max heard the bumping sounds of them climbing up into the bed, he closed the door and told them to hang on. The truck\"s wheels squealed as he drove around several zombies, and over several more. The crunching sounds combined with the bobbing up and down of the vehicle made him want to throw up, but they continued driving and were soon on the road away from the terrible place, and hopefully on the way towards somewhere safer. I\"m taking a slightly different writing approach with this story. Please tell me if you like it, dislike it, or haven\"t really noticed. Usual disclaimers. You\"d think that a story based on a Disney movie might be a bad plot in which to put zombies, but if you think about it... for that very same reason what better plot is there? Ha. I\"m trying to keep some Disney-esque humor in the story and hopefully Winifred\"s old English speak isn\"t too annoying. Please tell me what you think; this is kind of an experiment at the moment. Also, if anyone can think of a better name for the story, please tell me; this is just the best I could come up with. They had been driving for almost half an hour now; Jay directed Max towards where the crazy military veteran lived in the hopes he would be better prepared for the situation than they had been. And then there was the matter of the witches now having the potion... this night, or morning, rather, just kept getting worse. What were they going to do? Even if the vet was prepared for a zombie apocalypse there was no way they could destroy all of the ghouls before they hurt someone. Just the fact that there were so many of them to begin with was disconcerting and suggested there may already be victims. \"Make a left up here, man.\" Jay told Max as the latter looked at the road signs. As he realized what street was coming up he made a quick right, causing everyone to lean in the direction he was turning and for Jay to almost fall out of the truck. \"Hey, man! What are you doing?\" He shouted while trying to steady himself in the bed of the vehicle. \"This is the same road as the town hall; we\"ve got to warn my mom and dad!\" He responded. The teenagers in the bed of the truck both protested, but realized that they really couldn\"t just drive off. \"Max, are you sure that they\"ll even be alright when we get there?\" Allison asked him. \"No, I\"m not sure! But we\"ve got to at least go there!\" Max retorted, his voice harsher than he intended it to be. Dani shrunk but Allison maintained herself; her parents were at her house, and she was worried about them too. Unfortunately, they couldn\"t take the risk to go there to save only a few people compared to the large dance party going on at the town hall. There was still a mile or two before they would get to the building in which the dance was taking place and they honestly had no idea as to how they were going to convince their parents to believe a flesh-eating zombie horde had invaded the quiet town. After all, they hadn\"t even managed to convince the adults of the existence of the three witches, and that was before the trio had gotten onstage and cast a spell upon them by singing. Who knew? They were probably still dancing even now. Max ran a hand through his hair, trying to think of a solution, as they continued driving down the empty, lonely road. The air was shrill this early morning, but already the whispers of dawn were approaching on the wind; the Sanderson sisters did not have much time. Winifred scanned urgently for any signs of children still roaming the streets, but they were as dead as the eyes of the ghouls who had driven them from their home. Mary and Sarah were, of course, completely oblivious to their imminent conundrum and were instead acting like children. Several times, already, Winifred had been forced to scold the two for their foolishness, but soon they returned to their idiotic ways. The streets of Salem, Massachusetts were largely unoccupied, and not a soul seemed to be wandering the sidewalks. \"Twas a strange situation, considering only a short while ago they had been surrounded by undead fiends. Perhaps the chains of hell which directed them did not have enough sway to reach further into town. Or maybe they simply could not keep up with the sisters\" mounts sailing through the air high above the city. Their cloaks flapped about them as they swayed through the air. The sky was an open plain for the witches to travel as they would, reaching farther than the greatest ocean... wait, the air, the openness... \"Sarah! Use thy voice! Fill the sky! Bring the little brats to die!\" Winifred commanded her sister. Within moments the normally childish girl began singing, filling the whole town with her beautiful voice. \"Come little children, I\"ll take thee away, into a land of enchantment... come little children, the time\"s come to play, here in my garden of magic...\" She sang, her song floating on the wind. It took longer than usual, but they began to see little forms drawing out of their houses, many wearing pajamas and others still their obscure uniforms. The witches drifted down from the upper air currents towards the lower winds, as well as in the direction of a young boy with sandy blonde hair dressed in a red uniform with \"Star Trek: Redshirt\" on it in big yellow letters. They hadn\"t the time to ponder such intricacies as Winifred neared the sleepy boy, reaching out for him. However, as she did, another figure appeared out of nowhere and lunged onto the boy, causing him to scream as it bit him. Winifred withdrew her hand as if it had touched something hot and the sisters wafted away as the newly-appeared zombie continued to devour the boy. He likely would have survived longer had Sarah not called him out, but that was of ill importance now as they saw many other children being assaulted by the undead creatures. The fact that young lives were being extinguished mattered little to the redheaded leader of the trio, but what did matter was that with every meal the children served the grisly specters they took one away from her...them. \"Confound these devilish coffin-dwellers! We must find a child that is not within their reach!\" She cursed. Sarah looked about dumbly, like a kitten. Mary, meanwhile, was simply sniffing at the air, trying to pick up the scent of a child. Winifred felt her anger boiling over as she shouted at them about how she always had to do everything herself. Sarah drew her broom closer to Winifred\"s to comfort her, but the elder sister shoved her away. Though it was not her intent, Sarah was sent falling from her mount and down through the air, with both siblings calling after her. She bounced off of some kind of air-filled colorful house and down into a pool in the backyard of a home, followed shortly thereafter by her broom falling onto the lawn. Her sisters followed her down as they girl emerged from the pool. \"Sarah, are you alright?\" Mary called out to her. The young blonde woman\"s wet clothes hung to her slender frame and she pushed her long hair out of her face. \"I bounced off of a house made of some sort of bladder and into this large pool of water.\" She informed the two who had already realized what happened. Apparently she had either forgotten or was uninterested as to how she had fallen in the first place. Winifred looked about, pretending not to care as she spotted a child looking at them from the other side of a glass door of the house. \"Winnie... I smell a child.\" Mary told her, quickly being hushed by the elder sister as Sarah drew out of the pool and all three advanced on the house. \"My, what a wonderful costume you have on.\" Winifred complimented the young girl as they drew nearer to the house. The town hall of Salem was just as they had left it; dark on the outside with multi-colored lights and sounds of music within it. And every car they had seen before seemed to still be waiting patiently in the otherwise vacant parking lot. Max parked on the street since he hadn\"t been driving enough to feel comfortable parking the long vehicle in a cramped parking lot. The group got out of the truck and Max made sure he put the keys in a buttoned pocket to keep from losing track of them. They approached the back entrance to the building since that was where the \"main\" entrance for the dance was. No one awaited them at the entrance, meaning that they had either been drawn into the dancing frenzy or... no; if the place had been attacked then there wouldn\"t be people inside still playing music. Max ran up the stairs into the building, with everyone else close behind except for Binx, who hesitated at the entrance. It seemed like he had heard something, but when Dani called for him he followed them inside. They pushed their way into the main hall where the party was taking place and the entire group was relieved somewhat when they saw their parents were still there. Granted, they were in the throes of a spell that would make them dance until they died, but it was a great deal better than finding the entire large room coated with blood and who knew what else? At least this way they could try to find a way to snap them out of it. Saxophones, guitars, drums, vocals and more blared throughout what was tonight a dance hall as the parents wearing various costumes ranging from dramatic to outright dumb moved to the music. They dared through the mob of sweaty old people, searching for their parents. Though Jay, Allison, Ice met with no success Max and Dani found theirs more or less where they had before. The two adults, one dressed like Dracula and the other like Madonna, were dancing just as the others were and seemed completely oblivious to their presence. The siblings spoke to them, told them they needed help, but were met with minimal results. Everyone else met them at their parents\" location but despite their combined efforts they still achieved something comparable to nothing. Allison glanced nervously back at the door they had used to enter the building and could almost feel the zombies shambling up the steps, threatening to pour into the room full of food. \"Can you two go over there and stand by the door?\" She asked Jay and Ice. \"If they show up we\"ll need to know it.\" Neither of the teenagers seemed particularly thrilled by the idea, but being near the door wouldn\"t necessarily put them in danger, so they agreed and headed through the crowd. As the three remaining people tried to think of a way to get Max and Dani\"s parents to snap out of their trance, Binx told them to look on the stage. They saw skeletons in suits playing instruments, but that was just guys in makeup and costumes. However, as another, far more gruesome figure stumbled onto the stage, they realized that somehow one of them had gotten inside. And, as they saw more making their way from behind the curtains the situation suddenly became far worse than they had thought. Three things went through Max\"s mind as he watched the zombies clamber closer to the oblivious performers. The first was that the spell the Sanderson sisters had cast on the adults was about to be the least of their problems, the second was that they needed to get their parents out of here. And the third thing was that, no matter what they did, everyone else was going to die. A scream shrieked out through the speakers, making even the partygoers cover their ears at the overload of horrific noise as the singer fell to the ground with his assailant, red blood turning his once-white features a grisly muscle-colored pink. He was soon joined by the other members of the band and as each instrument ceased playing another, far louder and far more terrifying sound echoed to take their place. When the entire band\"s music degenerated to little more than painful, gurgling screams, the spell finally seemed to end. As Max, Dani and Allison turned back towards the now-terrified crowd Jay and Ice ran out from it, sweat on their foreheads and fear in their eyes. \"They\"re coming, man! They\"re far away but still-\" Jay was cut off as people in the crowd started screaming; apparently the zombies had made it further than just onto the stage. Max covered his face with his hands, trying to think of a way out of the situation. \"Max, what\"s going on?\" His father asked him, and he brought his hands down. His parents both seemed to be back to normal, scared and unsure, but back to normal. \"You\"re... you\"re alright.\" Dani hugged their mother as Max\"s father placed a hand on his shoulder. \"Max, what it is going on?\" The teenager took a deep breath and then told them the basic gist of everything that had happened. \"That\"s a lot to absorb... well, we need to get out of here, let\"s go.\" He said, and everyone agreed. They tried to make their way around the edge of the mob, reluctantly using the feeding frenzy in the middle of the room as a distraction, but as they grew close to the door a figure leapt out of the crowd and onto Dani, snapping at her face. Max and their father pulled the ghoul off of the girl before it could do her any damage, but it turned its attention to their dad and it took the combined efforts of Max, Jay and Ice to get it off of him and throw it back into the crowd.", "smiled then whispered, \"Can never say no to Marie Rocco, can you Murph?\" \"Shut up.\" Murphy said leaving once again. Connor turned around to see Marie getting supplies out on a portable table she brought. \"Connor your gonna have to wash your hands and put some gloves on.\" Marie said \"Why?\" Connor asked, really confused. \"You\"re gonna need to assist me.\" \"What?\" \"I can\"t do it by myself, just clear of the counter and get the sheet down and lay everything out, and we\"re gonna need better lighting so get the lamp from over there, but wash your hands first before you lay down the sheet.\" Marie said, while examining Jamie on the table. \"How does she look?\" Connor asked at the sink. \"She\"s got a collapsed lung besides that just peri orbital edema.\" \"What?\" \" It\"s swollen around her eye.\" \"Oh you could have just said that.\" Connor said laying down the sheet. \"I\"m gonna need to hook her up to a ventilator to help her breathe.\" Marie said grabbing a long tube out of a sterile bag. \"What\"s that for?\" \"It\"s a chest tube, I need to insert it down her throat to help open her airway. Hold her down for me, will you?\" \"Yea, what for?\" \"Sometimes the body will reject the tube if their not fully unconscious.\" Marie said opening Jamie\"s mouth and sliding the tube down her throat. \"I hate to do this when she could wake up at anytime, but I couldn\"t bring in the anesthesia machine someone was bound to notice that was missing. I need to give her a conscious sedative, so if she wakes up she won\"t move around.\" Marie told him while switching on the venerator. \"Scissors!\" Connor handed her the scissors. Marie cut off Jamie\"s shirt then laid a sheet over her so she wouldn\"t be exposed. \"Help me roll her over. Will ya.\" Marie looked up and saw Connors back was to her. \"Wow what a gentleman.\" \"Is she covered up?\" \"Yea, I\"ve got a sheet over her. You MacManus brothers always surprise me.\" \"I just thought I\"d give her some privacy, I\"m not a doctor and you know.\" Marie chuckled, \"Just help me roll her over.\" Carefully they rolled her over, \"We better get to work, We gotta get in there fast before she losses to much blood, wash your hands again, get a surgical gownon, then glove up. I\"ll do the same.\" When they were done \"scrubbing in\" Connor asked, \"So what do you need me to do?\" \"All you have to do is give me the right tools, I\"ll walk you through it. I\"ve given her one unit of blood and some platelets so she will make it through the surgery.\" \"How did you know what her blood type is?\" Connor asked \"She has a file at the hospital, she\"s B+. Scalpel!\" Connor handed it to her. She cut right over the bullet hole, then put the retractor in to separate the ribs and expose the wound. \"Ok I see her lung, yup collapsed, I need to get the bullet out then clean it out then, sew it up. Hand me the pick-ups, they look like tweezers\" Connor handed those to her. Marie put the pick-ups intoJamie\"s lung and within 10 seconds pulled it out with them closed around a bullet. \"Basin!\" Connor help it out and she dropped with bullet and tweezers into it. \"Suction!\" Connor did as he was told. \"I\"ve got to get the blood out of her lung, before I close her up and since I\"m already in here it will be easier to do it this way.\" Marie put the suction into the lung and it cleaned up most of the blood in there. \"Suture Needle!\" Connor handed her the curvy needle. Within a few minutes Marie had Jamie\"s lung sewed up and then her back sewed up. \"Gauze and tape!\" Marie put the gauze and taped it to Jamie\"s back where the cut was. \"You\"re gonna need to change the dressing, that\"s the gauze, 3 times a day with new gauze and clean up the wound with some ointment for her.\" Marie said taking off her gloves and surgical gown. \"Yea sure thing.\" Connor said doing the same. \"We should go and put her on the bed so she will be comfortable while she recovers. Can you carry her over there and I\"ll push the ventilator over?\" \"Sure.\" Connor said rolling her into his arms. He walked very carefully making she Marie was right behind him with the ventilator. He wouldn\"t want the tube ripping out. He walked into the bed room and laid her on the bed. He sat down next to her as Marie began to give her more blood and platelets. \"I\"ve only got 2 more units of blood, and she\"s gonna need one more. I\"ll have to go back and see if I can take one more.\" Connor thought about this for a second then said. \"Marie, I\"ll give her some.\" \"What?\" \"I\"m O+, I can give to anyone.\" He said holding out his arm. \"Hook me up!\" Marie came back into the bedroom with the iv tubing. \"Are you sure about this Connor?\" \"Yea I\"m sure, I\"ve donated blood before, it\"s the came thing, isn\"t it?\" \"You can\"t donate, you\"re Irish.\" \"Is that suppose to be some discrimination toward foreigners?\" \"No I only meant-\" \"Murph and I donated in Ireland, \"til we moved to the states.\" \"Oh, that makes sense. Well tt is the same thing only you\"re not trying to just fill up a bag, you\"re trying to fill up a person, and since we don\"t have a bag, I\"m not going to know how fast your blood is flowing so-\" \"So if I pass out you\"ll know I\"ve given her enough.\" Connor said smiling \"That\"s not what I was gonna say. I was going to say, so I\"m going to have to check your hemoglobin every 5 to 10 minutes. Ok so we need to let gravity do the work, so you\"re going to need to lay above her.\" \"Umm well if I was going to do that, it would be a little bit more romantic, there wouldn\"t be a tube down her throat and there wouldn\"t be someone else with us.\" Connor said adding a wink at the end. Marie started laughing, \"No, I meant lay above her like next to her but higher than she\"s laying.\" \"Yea, I know I just wanted to give you some shite.\" \"Thanks, lets bring the kitchen table in and you can lay on that since it\"s higher than the bed. But first I need to prick your finger to find out what your hemoglobin level is.\" \"Sure thing.\" Connor said giving Marie his finger, when she was done he went into the kitchen and got the table. \"Hey what\"s going on?\" Murphy said walking into the house. \"Connor here is gonna give Jamie some blood. Hey what\"s your blood type?\" Marie asked. \"Oh don\"t bother, he couldn\"t donate, you know \"cause of his disease!\" \"Oh fuck off Connor!\" Murphy said closing the door. Connor was amusing himself. \"I\"m just kidding, he\"s AB+ he can\"t give her any of his blood.\" \"That\"s so weird.\" \"What?\" Murphy said helping Connor with the table. \"I mean you guys are brothers, and some of the time you seem completely different and at other time you do act like twins, I mean sometimes you guys even dress alike, I mean you guys aren\"t 8 year old girls, you even have the same tattoo\"s.\" \"Well not all of our tattoo\"s are same.\" Murphy said coming back into the room. \"Yeah\" Connor said setting the table down, \"Murph\"s got a cute little bunny on his arse!\" Marie and Connor busted into a fit of laughter. Murphy just shook his head and sat down in the chair next to the bed. \"Connor what the hell, is it Pick-On-Murphy-Day in your head?\" \"It\"s not true is it?\" Marie said helping Connor get on the bed. \"Of course it\"s not.\" Connor said laying down. \"Okay, bend your knees, your hemoglobin level looks good.\" Marie checked Connors arm for a good vain. Once she found one, \"Make a fist for me.\" Connor did, she then put the tourniquet (the rubber band looking thing) around Connors arm, \"Okay you can relax.\" Then she cleaned off the spot with alcohol then some iodine. \"You ready Connor?\" \"Yup!\" Marie inserted the needle into Connors arm, then connected the needle to the hub then the hub to the tube. \"Okay some blood has to flow into the basin first before I connect the tube to Jamie, we can\"t have air from the tube get in. Alright its starting to flow, Connor here\"s a stress ball slowly squeeze it.\" Marie already had Jamie hooked up and ready to receive Connor\"s blood. \"Ok, looking good Connor, now I\"m gonna hook you up to Jamie.\" Connor looked over and say the red liquid flow into Jamie. \"You\"re really brave Connor for doing this.\" \"Yea I know.\" Connor said looking up at the ceiling. \"By the way you two did a great job redecorating Rocco\"s house.\" \"Yea, after Rocco,\" Connor paused a second, \"we, umm refurnished, repainted, and replaced all the faucets, sinks etc. of the whole house.\" \"When did you guys do all of this?\" Murphy chimed in, \"After Rocco\"s... funeral, and before the Yakavetta trial. Da helped as well.\" There was an awkward silence for a moment \"I\"m sorry, you guys.\" \"For what?\" Connor and Murphy said at the same time. \"I\"m sorry for being such a bitch you guys, since you two told me about Rocco.\" Marie paused and looked down at her hands. \"It was hard, ... it took me a long time to come to terms with Rocco being gone. The fact that I would never get to see him again, laugh at his jokes. But I didn\"t realize until just now, that it must have been at least 10 times harder for you guys. You guys still have trouble saying he\"s gone. He was just as much my brother as he was yours and he was killed right in front of you two. I still remember the day you guys coming to my door, telling me, the pain in your eyes.\" \"You look like him, ya know. Just without the facial hair.\" Connor said Marie chuckled. \"Yea I know, our fathers blue eyes, our mothers dark curly hair.\" Marie looked over at Murphy and saw him looking at her in a way she had never seen him look at her. Murphy quickly got up, \"Anyone want anything to drink?\" \"I\"ll have an ice tea if you got it.\" Marie said. \"Juice for me.\" Connor replied. Murphy stopped dead in his tracks and turned around, \"What?\" \"I should drink something sweet, shouldn\"t I?\" Connor asked looking at Marie. \"Yea, that right, no beer.\" Marie said smiling, looking at Murphy. Connor noticed Murphy\"s cheeks turn a little red before he turned around to go to the kitchen. \"Poor bastard!\" Connor said without thinking. \"What?\" Marie said. Connor sighed, \"I know it\"s not my place,\" Connor started lowering his voice, \"and Murph will kill me if he knew I told you, but he sort of fancies you.\" \"Really?\" Marie said still smiling. \"Yea, but he\"s not gonna make the first move. You bein\" Rocco\"s sister and all.\" \"Here we go one ice tea,\" Murphy said coming back in from the kitchen, \"and one juice.\" \"Thanks\" Marie said taking a sip, \"I should probably check Jamie\"s hemoglobin, Connor looks a little faint.\" Marie poked Jamie\"s finger, then Connors and set them on the text stands. \"Her blood level is almost normal.\" \"Almost? Well then just keep me plugged in until it is normal.\" \"She has the same amount that someone who would have donated would have. You on the other hand are a little low so you\"re gonna have to take it easy for the next few hours.\" Marie said unhooking Connor from the tube then going over to unhook Jamie. She then wrapped up Connors arm with a dressing then Jamie\"s. \"Well then Murph I\"ll take that beer now.\" \"No beer for a while, you need sweets, drink juice and eat some cookies or something with sugar in it.\" \"Fine.\" Connor said getting up. \"As for me I need to get home and get some sleep. I\"ll stop by tomorrow morning to check on her, I\"ve got her hooked up to an IV, but I won\"t be able to get anymore pain meds until tomorrow night. So if she wakes up she\"s gonna have to tough it out. Oh and if she does wake up she might start struggling with the tube because if might bother her. If it does it means she can breath on her own and you\"ll have to take it out. You remember what it looked like?\" Marie asked Connor \"Yea it looked like a J.\" \"Right, you\"ll need to tell her to relax and that it will hurt so she can\"t struggle and she needs to take a deep breathe and exhale while you take it out. You need to be extremely careful you don\"t want to do anymore damage. \"Ok I think I can manage.\" Connor said looking at Jamie. \"Oh and Connor, if you feel faint lay down and put you legs up like I had them.\" Murphy chuckled to himself and Marie just rolled her eyes. \"If something goes wrong call me ASAP. Murphy will you help me bring some of this stuff to the car?\" \"Yea, no problem.\" Murphy said. Connor heard the door close. He finished his juice then got up off the table. He walked over to Jamie. He noticed she looked less pale but then he saw the two bruises on her face. One just above her eye and one starting to form from the cut on her lip. That fuckin\" bastard! Connor thought. \"You\"ll never guess what just fuckin\" happened!\" Murphy said coming back in from outside. \"What?\" Connor said already know what happened. \"Marie just asked me out, man. Can you fuckin\" believe it?\" \"No, not at all.\" Connor said in a not quite convincing tone, walking back into the kitchen to get another cup of juice from the refrigerator. \"You fuckin\" arse!\" \"What?\" Connor said closing the refrigerator door reveling a smirk on his face. \"You told her!\" \"Told her what?\" \"You fuckin\" know what!\" That when they heard it, chocking, Connor turned toward the bedroom and saw Jamie struggling trying to pull the tube out of her throat. \"Oh shit!\" \"Calm down, you\"re okay.\" Thought Connor was trying to calm her down, she kept fighting the tube, \"Jamie listen to me,\" Connor put his hand on either side of her face, and looked deep into her blue eyes, \"I\"m going to take the tube out but you must calm down.\" Jamie slowly started to calm down. Connor deflated the cuff securing the tube. \"Okay Jamie on the count of three I want ya to take a deep breath and exhale. Okay,\" Jamie nodded at him. \"One Two Three,\" Jamie took a deep breath in. Then while she exhaled Connor pulled the tube out of her throat. \"There it\"s out. It might hurt to talk so take it easy, alright?\" Jamie nodded again. Connor went into the kitchen to put the tube in a bag Marie had left, \"Crisis diverted.\" Connor said to Murphy who was on the phone, \"Oh sorry.\" \"Just Marie, she said now that she\"s up she can have some ice chips, then some sips of water, then Jell-O then some soup.\" Connor got the ice chips that Marie had left in the freezer. Since Murphy was on the phone Connor went back to Jamie. \"Where am I?\" Jamie said in a raspy voice. \"You\"re safe, this is one of our houses, no one can hurt you here.\" Connor said handing her the ice chips. \"What makes you think someone would want to hurt me?\" \"Let\"s see since we saw a man shoot you after we heard him beat you.\" Jamie looked down at her hands and her cheeks went red. \"There\"s nothing to be embarrassed about. You don\"t have to play the tough person here, but we would like to know how you got yourself into that crowd.\" \"My boyfriend. That\"s the reason I was with those men to begin with.\" \"Who would be...?\" Connor asked. \"Alex Cerniglia.\" Jamie said, still looking down at her hands. \"Murph, you might want to get in here.\" Connor said. \"What?\" Murph replied coming into the room. \"Alexander Cerniglia is her boyfriend.\" Connor said in a low voice. \"We had the right room then! Damn.\" \"Oh my god!\" Jamie said suddenly looking from Murphy to Connor. \"You\"re the Saints.\" \"What makes you think that?\" Murphy said. \"I recognize you from TV. Granted those shitty ass drawing they had up look nothing like you two.\" Jamie said smiling. Connor and Murphy\"s mood changed drastically. Fuck Connor thought Now she can ID us! \"I can\"t believe you guys actually rescued me.\" \"What?\" Connor and Murphy said. \"I\"ve been trying to leave Alex for months, but he knows my family and if I would have tried to leave him he wouldn\"t rest until me and everyone related to me was dead. About two weeks ago, I remembered the ordeal between you and the Yakavetta\"s and I prayed for God to send you to deal with Cerniglia, so I could leave.\" Jamie said, Connor could see the life in her eyes, the excitement the twinkle of being free. \"Well we haven\"t gotten him yet, and hopefully if our plan works out as we hope it will. Everyone will think you\"re dead.\" Murphy said. \"What? What are you talking about? I\"m supposedly dead? What about my family? What do they-\" Jamie stopped short to catch her breath. \"If we hadn\"t shown up you would be. That guy was beating you to death, he had a gun to you!\" Connor yelled standing up. \"Connor! Calm down! You just told her that her family and everyone she loves thinks she\"s dead! Think of how they must feel.\" Murphy said. \"So I\"ll never be able to see my family and friends again?\" Jamie asked. \"You will be able to see them just not until Cerniglia is dead, then it would be safe for you to go home.\" Connor said. \"Until then you need to lay low, you can\"t go out if anyone see\"s you we\"re all fucked.\" Jamie didn\"t say anything for a few minutes. \"That\"s not going to work, I won\"t be your guys hostage!\" \"Our hostage? What makes you think we\"re holding you hostage.\" Connor said. \"We don\"t know how this works out? We\"ve never been able to \"save\" anyone before. You\"re our first, we risked our identities being exposed to save you. We risked our lives to save you.\" Murphy said. \"You know what I think, we should all sleep. It\"s 4 in the morning and most of us haven\"t slept at all maybe we should continue this in the morning. Once we\"re all rested. * * * The next morning Connor got up, Murphy had left to fill Noah in. Jamie was awake but still on the single bed, watching the TV. \"Morning, how ya feeling?\" Connor said, walking into the room with some Jell-O \"Fine, I guess. My throat\"s a lot better.\" \"That\"s good.\" Connor pulled up a chair. \"What\"s the last thing you remember?\" He asked giving her the Jell-O. \"I remember Vincenzo was yelling at me telling me Alex wanted me dead, he hit me, aimed his gun at me, I heard a noise, and rolled over to get away then it gets a little blurry, then nothing until I woke up here. Can you tell me something?\" \"Go ahead.\" \" I\"d like to know why I had a tube in my throat and why I\"m extremely sore.\" Jamie asked. \"The man who hit you when we came in, Vincenzo you called him, he saw us, must have hit you then tried to hit us but he was down before he got the chance, I went over to you and thought you were already gone, but I saw your hand move and you asked me to help you so Murph drove us here and we had a doctor come and fix you up.\" \"What happened? Is the bullet out?\" \"Yea it hit your lung and it collapsed, she fixed it up but you lost a lot of blood, so she gave you a blood transfusion.\" \"How did you know what my blood type is?\" \"You had a file at the hospital, but she didn\"t have enough time to get to the hospital, so she gave you mine.\" \"Yours? Why?\" \"I\"m O positive, which is rare and means I can donate blood to anyone.\" \"Oh, well thanks.\" Jamie looked at Connor Why would he do that for someone he barley knows, hmm he\"s cute. Jamie thought, \"So when can I-\" At that moment Rocco\"s sister came in with Murphy. \"So how\"s our patient doing?\" Marie said. \"Good, I guess.\" \"I\"m Doctor Marie Rocco. You look like you\"re doing well, have you gotten up yet?\" \"Yea I have, very slowly.\" Connor looked at her, \"When?\" \"About two hours ago, I had to use the bathroom.\" Marie took out a stethoscope to check on Jamie, \"On a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being the highest, how\"s your pain?\" \"I\"d say a 3 when I\"m staying still, but a 5 when I\"m moving around.\" \"That seems about right.\" Marie wrote some things down, \"Your vitals seem good, I\"d wait a few more hours until eating some soup. You can start eating whole food, gradually, probably tomorrow afternoon. Take everything real slow, you can shower today, I brought some extra gauze and tape. So one of you guys will have to redress the wound. Besides that you seem like you\"re doing well. I\"ll be back later tonight to check on you.\" Marie turned around and said to Connor and Murphy, \"See you guys later.\" \"I think I\"ll take that shower.\" Jamie said getting up, Connor got over to her to help her out of the bed. \"Thanks. I got it from here.\" Jamie walked down the dark hallway to the bathroom. \"So I talked to Da,\" Murphy said sitting down to the table. \"He doesn\"t think she\"ll talk but he would like to talk to her, so he\"s gonna stop by later.\" \"Could one of you guys remove this gauze?\" Jamie yelled from down the hall. Murph looked at Connor, \"She\"s all yours.\" Connor just shook his head and walked down the hall. Connor knocked on the door, \"Come in.\" Jamie replied. Connor came in to see Jamie\"s back to him with a towel around her waist. Connor carefully removed the tape, while he did he noticed some marks on her back that were black and blue marks. He didn\"t say anything just figured it was from the surgery, \"How does it look? The incision, I mean?\" \"Clean.\" Connor was done quickly. \"Thanks,\" Jamie said not turning around. \"Yup.\" Connor said hesitating a second then walking out of the room. Connor went back to the kitchen shaking his head. \"What\"s up?\" Murphy asked. \"She\"s got bruises on her back. It\"s odd.\" Connor said sitting down. \"Probably from the surgery.\" \"That\"s what I\"m thinking. Just something doesn\"t seem right.\" * * * Jamie dried herself off then realized she didn\"t have any other clothes and didn\"t want to get back into the dirty clothes she was laying in. She finished towel drying her hair then wrapped the towel around her body and left the bathroom. \"Do you have any swears or a t-shirt or something I can wear?\" Jamie said walking into the kitchen slowly. She saw the looks on Connor and Murphy\"s face. \"What?\" \"Holy shit!\" Connor said. Murphy sat there with his mouth open in terror. \"What?\" \"Your,\" Connor started then paused a moment, \"Your covered in bruises, what the fuck did he do to you?\" 3"]}
{"id": "3c6c188a-db28-59aa-8c09-3d0f799ff579", "fandoms": ["Guardians of Ga'Hoole", "Warriors"], "pair": ["I shift a bit, warily letting my eyes dart from one owl to the other -- but my eyes are trained on the Barn Owl the most. Like Hoole...so like Hoole... He turns a bit, and our eyes meet directly. I can\"t describe it...in this next moment, I don\"t look away, how awkward it seems. I stare into his eyes. They\"re like Hoole\"s... They are Barn Owl eyes, but Hoole\"s eyes. They\"re his eyes...Hoole\"s eyes... They hold that light of valor, justice, that one glow that I always made me feel my gizzard twitch in the bottom of my heart. Hoole... He never wanted me, did he? He loved me, but only who I was pretending to be. He never loved me, only Emerilla...lucky owl. I just wanted to belong -- because I was nothing -- and he gave me that. He was so fair, so kind...he gave me something even Kreeth could not. Mum and Da -- Ygryk and Pleek -- were supposed to be my parents. I was supposed to be their chick, Lutta. Yet they left me. They talked about me behind my back...I was a freak. My own parents loathed me. Oh, they tried, but they left in the end. They didn\"t love me. Kreeth used me. No one really loved me, or even looked at me normally. All I was was a freak, nothing at all. Then he came along. Him, Hoole. The only one who let me belong, looked at me with kindness in his gaze, not looking like I was a...monster... Why was I born? Not one person cared about me. I was just freak my parents didn\"t want, a weapon for auntie\"s uses, and a fake to my only love. He cared, but didn\"t know me. In the end, I was a monster to him too. Now I\"m back. And now I wonder... I suddenly stiffen as I think up to a thought. \"What happened?\" I shoot up and stare into those kind eyes. I trust him to answer. \"Please, who are you? Where am I? Where\"s...Where\"s\"--I choke up, but the question is already on my tongue--\"Hoole?\" My talons clench as the name leaves me. At once, I see sympathy clearly written over their faces. A pang enters my heart. Sympathy for me? A nothing? \"Lutta.\" Sweet words again, and I suddenly wonder how this Barn Owl knows my name. \"It\"s hard to explain, but please...\" \"Listen carefully.\" Everyone, including me, jumps as the Great Gray speaks -- in a rather booming voice -- for the first time. The Elf Owl frowns at him. The older Barn Owl gives him a quick nudge. Words tumble from the young Barn Owl\"s beak. \"Lutta, we read about you in legends. It\"s been a long time since you were... \"Well, you\"re at the Great Ga\"Hoole Tree, and it\"s been a long time since you were...\" His voice dies down as he hesitates. \"Dead,\" the older Barn Owl finishes. He says it with that sympathy shown in his eyes. \"It\"s been thousands of years from your time, and we read about you from some legends about some...events...\" He clears his throat, determined to go on. \"Coryn here\"--a gesture at the young Barn Owl--\"is the king. I\"m his uncle, Soren. This is Gylfie\"--a gesture at the Elf Owl, who nods in greeting--\"Twilight,\" the Great Gray, \"and Digger\"--what a funny looking Burrowing Owl. \"My uncle and his friends are called the Band,\" Coryn adds. I let this newfound information seep in. Thousands of years? Could this be possible? I was dead, right? It\"s been so long -- and...I was dead? How...? \"I have a GIZZARD!\" \"You do not have a gizzard, you fool! you idiot! I created you.\" \"You created me, but I created this gizzard!\" \"No!\" What is this? \"Emerilla?\" He turns as I change. He knows now...what am I to do? Dismay spreads through my body. He\"ll probably think I\"m a freak too, and he\"ll hate me. But I love him! In the next second, I\"m flying at him. Adrenline floods me as I feel...am I losing myself? This gref... He\"ll hate me now. I slam into him, and he flies backward. \"I love you!\" I want to scream. I want to scream those three words. To let him understand. I want to scream, \"I love you!\" Then, an enexpected blow to the back of my head. Pain. Unexpected pain. Then talons, stopping me in my tracks. Talons...digging into me, slashing everywhere. My vision spins to red. I\"m being ripped apart at the seams. Torn. No... Why are you...? I sink, and I fall apart, literally. My feathers fall off, as my body becomes a lump of darkness. A lump of feathers. I truly am nothing... You\"d expect a real body when one is torn by claws -- and yet...feathers only. My phantom gizzard lurches. \"Half-hags!\" \"I had to kill her.\" WHY? \"She pretended to be my Emerilla.\" Is that all! I\"m going to die like this! Just because I was an imposter! \"I knew from the start that something was not right about her. A blood deception she was -- a hagsfiend.\" Anger -- hot, seeping rage enters me. And cold feelings. Feeling that make me want to shed tears. \"No!\" I manage. \"Who are you?\" Who? Hoole...you accept me as someone? Hoole... \"I am nothing...and yet, I loved...\" I loved... \"Lutta?\" \"Hey! Are you all right?\" \"What\"s wrong? Lutta!\" I sink down as my mind spins. Then, I black out. All was dark except for the fluttering movement of wings -- brown wings. A Barn Owl shifted in the branches of the magnificent tree, her dark eyes gleaming as she looked into the hollow. How strange that she could get so close to the tree so easily. She was but a sillhouette against the branched skies. She eyed the hollow, and the inhabitants. Her son...too bad she would have to kill him. He would have made a fine pure owl, had he not inherited his uncle\"s stupid softness. She could just kill him, right there and then. How easy, that everything she had been working for for the last few months would just be completed now, so easily. She could easily snatch the ember, then swoop in and kill Coryn, his disgraceful uncle, and get her dear mate\"s -- rest his soul -- revenge. Then, kill those pathetic owls that were always around Soren, and anyone else she comes across in the tree, just for a bonus. It would be wonderful to see their pained, stupefied faces as she sank her claws through their feathers, one by one. Then she saw the hagsfiend, and her eyes widened in horror. I am the last! How is this possible? Why is she in that hollow! She could just kill her as well -- but her eyes caught something, and her gizzard twitched. No...she\"ll just stay back and observe. This hagsfiend could prove some use to her and... Sadistic impulse shot through Nyra\"s gizzard. The adoring gleam in the hagsfiend\"s eye as she stared at Nyroc. No, she\"ll wait. Nyra silently spread her wings and swooped into the night sky. She had plotting to do. PT: Please, enjoy :) I hope I can fill up some holes in the story as soon as I can. Though, they\"re there for suspense. Please review! Nothing, Yet A Love Never Dying PT: THANKS SO MUCH FOR READING, EVERYONE!! Enjoy! I have a little more to say: I know the last book already came out, and I\"ve finished it already. I\"m a little stunned, but in courtesy of those who have not yet finished it, I won\"t spoil it. However, despite the end, I\"m continuing the fic the way it is. I\"ve just noticed how much I\"ve been neglecting the story O.o Anyways, I was rather...displeased with a few stories stuck in the GoGH fandom, and while I was planning to leave it after finishing this fic, I might a few more fics for this. Not that I have hubris...I just...don\"t know...I just think I\"ll contribute to the fandom with a few fics of angst :D Anani Mouse Thank you, thank you so much :D -Head swells- Frosted Fate Yeah, poor Lutta D: Wish Hoole ended up with her. One of the Populace Oh...-sobs- Hi! :D FlamingSerpent Thanks! I\"m flattered x) True, Nyra\"s so important to the plot -- being sadistic and plotting revenge, among other things :) Hawkrain I\"m glad you\"re eager :D Thanks for reviewing and liking it! :) Lara-Van Thank you, thank you -bows- X) It\"s great that you think that; cheered me right up ;) The Great Tree I can make them hurt... My Mum and Da. I can make them feel the pain that they\"ve put on me. They can hurt, and I\"d be able to do it to them. A change in our positions is want I want so badly, and they\"d taste the bile they stuck in my throat. They left me...they left me, their chick Lutta. Theirs. I have the power now -- to make them hurt. I can make them hurt. I can make them hurt... \"Lutta!\" Stop slapping me. \"Lutta, wake up!\" Slap. Stop slapping me with your wing, it stings. Slap. Slap. \"WAKE UP, Lutta.\" Slap. Slap. Stop it! I\"m trying to-- \"Lutta, please!\" ...Hoole? Hoole\"s voice! I flick my eyelids open -- all four of them -- at the same time. Hoole? No, it\"s Coryn. Just Coryn. \"Lutta, are you all right?\" The way he looks at me...it\"s like Hoole. So much like Hoole. \"I\"m fine,\" I answer, and immediately scan my surroundings. Perhaps I have become overly paranoid with time, but I can\"t be sure. In any case, I can\"t let my guard down in this case; I could find myself dead in a second, just like that I died in an instant -- killed by Strix Strumajen. I shudder, remembering the memory of being ripped. Ripping, ripping, tearing, blood, pain-- Death. And then... Well, I don\"t want to think about what I don\"t remember. After that, there was nothing but a cluster of memories of what happened within death-- Falling. Falling... Floating...unraveling...flowing through the winds...becoming one with nature...then falling.... Falling, falling downwards, a curse uttered upon my kind: \"To hagsmire.\" Hagsmire, where the ones who have sinned within their lives went, for eternal damnation. Hagsmire, for hagsfiends, and...and... Nothings. Nothings -- they who mean nothing to the world, who should never have entered this life, this realm of breathing. Falling, agony, curses, darkness, cold hate. Those flaws of what life and death decide. And nothings. Nothings, like me. Nothing. Snap out of it. I don\"t want to remember. Of being one of the damned. And now I\"m back. Why? \"Lutta?\" -- and I look up. Hoole -- no, Coryn. Coryn, the Barn Owl. Unconsciously, I stare at him with huge eyes that deserve to pop out of their sockets. \"Yes?\" I say. Oh Coryn, please don\"t look at me like that. You look like Hoole, please, don\"t look sympathic...please don\"t...I want it but you don\"t have to give it. Can you not see that my heart has already been broken? \"Lutta,\" he says, softly, and gives me a tender nudge with his wing. \"Can you stand?\" I nod, because I cannot find myself shaking my head. \"Yes.\" Can my legs work? He steps back slightly, to give me room, and I try to remember how to use legs again. Now, I just...position them...and push upwards... A searing pain. My legs! They hurt! They hurt! Fall down again -- No, I can\"t. I can\"t fall; I\"ve told Coryn that I will stand, will be able, and I will not lie; not anymore; I have already lied and tricked Hoole, I will not do so again, not to any owl. Nor this owl. This owl, who stares with the eyes of a true king. A young king, but a wise one, and a good one. With difficulty, I stagger forward, out of the small nest. I feel the bark underneath my claws as I step on it; bark again, how it brings back thoughts of those days. It feels a bit unfamiliar, but I cannot forget bark. Such a thing is pathetic. I feel my legs quivering, wanting to give way, but no. No. I have said that I will stand. How they quiver! -- stop it. Stop quivering! I have said I will walk, and I will walk, even if this pain continues -- like fire searing at me, numbing in a way. I will not lie again. Deception has torn me once before; never again. I look at Coryn, see the concern in his eyes; he hesitates to step forward, wanting to help. No, I can do it. Please. Let me. I walk, a little faster, wanting my legs to stride. They work, a little better. I look at Coryn again, and I ask, \"Where am I?\" \"The Great Ga\"Hoole Tree.\" Silence. My breathe hitches quickly. \"The...\" I pause, mind spinning and reeling. The Tree? The Great Ga\"Hoole Tree, that was reigned over by...Hoole? \"Tree?\" The Tree. The Great Ga\"Hoole Tree. And my mind explodes. \"Th -- Then!\" I jump as I begin stuttering. \"The Ga\"Hoole Tree! I -- I don\"t belong here! I am nothing! I lo-- \"Hoole, he...NO! I am a disgrace! My presence is dirtying this tree!\" I back away, seeking some sort of exit. I don\"t belong here. No. I am defiling the Tree. How long has it been since the last time I was here? I deceived the good king, I nearly killed him -- he was a great king, and a great owl! I don\"t deserve to be here! How many good owls reside in this tree now, the Tree that was grown by -- as rumor says -- the sorrow and goodness of Hoole? I don\"t belong here! Coryn jumps now. Please, no! \"Lutta!\" he says, eyes flashing with some sort of fire that started. \"You are not!\" Not? But...Hoole! Hoole! -- please no! You--! I stare, transfixed, as I see Coryn change. I don\"t see Coryn anymore. I see...you. Hoole. Eyes, eyes that spoke of what you believed in. Your sense of love for those close to you, your fiery will that would see indiscrimation to the very end. I\"m sorry Hoole! I deceived you! I am everything you are not! -- and should not be! I am NOTHING! I back away, seeing Hoole. He steps forward, that look in his eyes-- \"You deserve to be here! You--\" I stumble backwards as I shriek, \"Hoole! Don\"t! Don\"t you understand!\" Now is my time to confess! I never told him that I was-- I\"m sorry Hoole. I\"m so sorry! \"Lutta!\" The owl before me is -- He\"s pleading! No, I don\"t deserve it! \"Lutta, you do! Just as any owl!\" My gizzard throbs, beating against its surroundings. I stare upwards, feeling it grow cold. \"NO! I DON\"T DESERVE TO BE HERE! I AM NOTHING! I -- DO -- NOT -- BELONG -- HERE! I AM...\" My gizzard gives a jerk. My throat fills with pebbles; \"Nothing....\" My words are choked. It\"s true. I am nothing. I don\"t deserve to be here, at the Great Tree. PT: Like? Hate? Please review. I hope to update soon. Fill up the plot holes, twist the story...you know.

SamPD Mmhm...since I\"ve already replied to you... Crazydragonlord Thank you~! n_n I appreciate that. Move Again, Step By Step Nyra glanced down at the small bit of parchment in her right claw, squinting slightly to make out the ancient words. The Kraakish scrawled upon it was old, but young enough for her to translate. The general of the Pure Ones had to stop the glee that was bubbling upwards in her gizzard -- no, not yet, when this isn\"t confirmed to work -- but she allowed herself to flush slightly with success. For the sake of her sanity and her own feelings of encouragement. Success was near... Nearing... ...Bit -- by -- bit. \"Yes.\" A glint came to concentrated eyes. \"This is it.\" I look up. Consciousness is drifting back with a comforting steadiness. It comes kindly, but firmly. But I let it come. Hell. My body aches -- all of it, it aches and hurts and pinches itself. It\"s a twisted rag -- I\"m a twisted rag. Hoole. Coryn. Oh... I shouldn\"t be here. The thought is fire, or else ice. I shouldn\"t be here. I don\"t deserve to be here. My thoughts are taking flight from where they have left off. I don\"t deserve to be here. Of course I don\"t. I look around as my vision clears; he is not here...Coryn, was it? No one is here. My phantom gizzard -- phantom, yes... -- speaks...it sends a jolt of alarm. Warning. They have left me. They must have. Kind as they seemed to be, they must have left me here...in this hollow...perhaps wanting me to leave on my own, too disgusted to act. A saddening thought. They acknowledged me, though, and they were kind. Perhaps they saw through to something... But that\"s reality, is it not? -- of course, freak that I am; player of the confidant game that I am...an actor, nothing more. There is no real me. My grief has quieted. I should leave then -- it cracks my phantom gizzard in half -- this is the tree; and I am nothing. I shall leave then...go somewhere else to rot, quietly, for the peace. This tree has something...something...that revives Hoole\"s life. I wonder, then...if he is looking down here. I wonder what he is thinking. At least he is at peace. There is no me to disturb him, and I shall bother him no more in this tree. Hoole. I am sorry. I don\"t deserve any of your love. And I will not bother Coryn. He reminds me so much of you. I turn to face the opening of the hollow, veiled by lichen. Pretty. How alive. There is air outside; nighttime seeps through the fleshy fibers. Cool air, and a wide expanse. Shall I fly till the end of my miserable days? I shift; I can move. Then I can leave. There is no reason to stay here, of course...this is Hoole\"s home; I shall not taint it. Oh, it\"s silent -- I can\"t believe it took so long for me to notice it; my feathers are rustling -- I must look ugly -- and my feet shift. I can move. This is life. I am alive. Truly, truly alive. I cannot tell what exact state I am in, but I know I must be a mess. But outside I can release, can I not? Release, and perhaps become one with nature, earth or sky. There is a whole world out there, limitless. I can wander till the end of my days, past even the confinements of the land we owls know. Beyond the beyond the beyond. I fear no danger; in fact, the danger can come, and I shall not care if it kills me. I am an owl -- whatever I am -- with nothing to lose and nothing to gain. Then I am ready. I listen one more time, pause, before beginning the endless journey. Nothing. There is nothing but the hum of silence, scratching in cadence. I must be desperate to stay, as if I truly deserve it. I don\"t. I cannot stop thinking about this; I deserve nothing. I am nothing, after all. If I am damned to this line of reality for this whole retake at life, then so be it. Then, I will take my leave. Good riddance, then. My eyes mist. When I shake my head to clear the fog, I hop forward -- painful -- and I manage to walk. I can do this. There is the opening; I will go now. I must be cherishing the whisper of lush wind. I will go. I will go. With a shake of my ruffled feathers, I jump out, brush through the lichen that caresses my wings in farewell -- with pity? -- and snap my wings open. A prickling sensation. With a quick look downwards, as the world rushes in, I see the silver-gray plumage restored to my chest. A shapeshifter again. Coryn watched the candle before him splutter wetly, in its final throes of death. Though fire was life, it needed something to last. Something that helped it, hurled it onward. Without, it would die, die and scream. Then it would fall silent and blow out of existence. And that would be that. Died, and was dead. But undoubtedly, irrevocably, dead. How, then...how? -- how did a dead owl, undoubtedly gone for years upon years upon years...how could a dead owl rise, fresh and breathing, from the dead? This was illogical, and beyond the illogical itself. Of course there could be attempts to raise the dead, but...the body. And the sheer closeness to impossibility. Lutta, the owl of legend, was alive after being dead for so long. How...? Her body must have withered and become nothing but food for the earth to devour greedily. Though the beyond of the horizon of the logical was boundless, this was still... How, he mused. How. That was what he was pursuing. How? How? How? How had she returned to the earth? Was she an illusion? -- if so, she was something beyond illusion...she was too perfect to be something to be called a mere illusion. Coryn mused onward as he turned back to the sheafs of paper -- he had left Lutta for the pursuit of something...something that could shed its light upon the happenings. So long ago. Lutta. Was this a work of nachtmagen? There was that possibility, faded as the yellow craft was. Then who had performed it? Coryn could not grab it; he snatched at empty air. There was nothing to tell him. Nothing that anything could tell him, nor aid him. This was an enigma beyond most anagrams of matters. This was a mess. He had found her, Lutta, merely lying on some branch of the tree. And, through some urging of the gizzard, he had brought her back into the tree itself. This made little sense. He dived into another pool of thoughts. What if...? There was a bang; he jumped and turned. There was a curse of \"raccdrops!\" Twilight. Coryn called, one wing still laid flat over a book, \"What\"s going on?\" More cursing, followed by Gylfie\"s reprimands. There was a loud whirlwind of a flutter, and soon the whole Band was within the room! \"What?\" Coryn said loudly at the undignified relative of a heap before him. \"What\"s happened?\" Something shot through his gizzard. Soren spoke first, in a rushed but determined voice. \"She\"s gone!\" Another shot. Something like cold fear and wonder. \"She\"s gone!\" Gylfie wailed. \"Lutta\"s gone!\"", "Suddenly, a piece of ice falls into the pit of my stomach. I\"m thinking as I near and I freeze. This is wrong. I jerk back, my head spinning. I am...a loyal ThunderClan...warrior... I am...a...honorable warrior, member of ThunderClan...who knows of the old days and new ones...and will never forget our old home, which we had lived in for...StarClan knows how long. I consciously lick my own paw and swipe it over my face, but I\"m already embarrassed. I absolutely loathe this moment. I hope no one else saw me try to lick Swallowtail. Things are different now... Very true, but I wish they weren\"t. \"Sorry,\" I meow quietly, \"I keep forgetting, things are different now.\" She licks me. I blink. \"Yes,\" she meows seriously, \"but it\"s all right to do this at Gatherings. We aren\"t breaking the warrior code to be friendly at this point. \"It do feel that we\"d best let our leaders know that we have not forgotten our places.\" That explains why she had asked for permission from Leopardstar. \"Our Clan is doing well,\" I murmur. Swallowtail flicks my ear with her tail; she used to always do that on the journey. \"So\"s ours,\" she meows. Swallow me up, Swallowtail, I want to be with you forever. Swallow me up and end the pain of losing you to the laws of our ancestors. I\"ll only ever let you hurt me. Although you don\"t mean it, it\"s because of the warrior code. I\"d never let anyone but you harm me, because I really like you, and I trust you to never hurt me intentionally, even for the sake of your Clan. Yet, to tell the truth, dear Swallowtail, you...not intentionally, but you... ...You already had. Swallowtail I gasp as I hear the news at the Gathering. No... It can\"t be...it just can\"t! NO! PLEASE! StarClan, NO! Don\"t let it be true, oh, please! Don\"t let it be true... Please, no. I pray to StarClan... Please, don\"t let it be true. It\"s a lie, I know it is. He can\"t be gone. He couldn\"t have left me... No... Firestar bows his head as he breaks the news. Please, StarClan, don\"t let him repeat that lie again- \"Rainwhisker is dead.\" NO! I unsheathe my claws and let them sink into the earth beneath me. No... Please, that... I won\"t accept it! That\"s a lie! A LIE! I will not accept such a LIE! I\"m an elder now, elder forevermore until I join the ranks of my warrior ancestors. Only, I want to join now. It\"s a lie that Rainwhisker is dead, but I still need to join. For, there, there are no boundaries of love. We shall walk the skies forever there, in the Great Beyond. Till then, I shall continue to hear the lie that Rainwhisker is dead. For I shall never accept that he is gone. It is a lie. The grief, however, still tears at my heart. It\"s raining there, in my chest, the raindrops cold and hard, coming out in a spray, making the drops feel like thorns. He is not gone. That lie... Raining upon an incomplete hole in my heart.

THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT!! \"...\" PT: Eheheheh... -PT shoves Brambleclaw in a box with Ashfur- PT: OKAY! HERE WE GO!! Tawnypelt I look around me as we gather for a Clan meeting. I am all alone. Almost my whole Clan still ignores me, for which Clan I was born into. It\"s stupid, completely mouse-brained. Some of this stupidity comes from hypocrisy. After all, Blackstar once committed crimes that were so unforgivable; he probably deserved a slow, long, painful death. Russetfur was one of those cats too. Both she and Blackstar helped Brokentail with his crimes and then Tigerstar. Now, they are both in powerful positions and shunning me; to them, I\"m just a lump of dirt. It\"s fox-brained. The only cats who bother to acknowledge me are Boulder, Runningnose, Tallpoppy, her kits and Littlecloud. They are kind. Today, however, the Gathering is for Tallpoppy\"s kits\" apprenticeship start. Tallpoppy herself has a slight cold and Littlecloud is treating her. Runningnose and Boulder are both tired. I am sitting there, all alone, shunned completely as the ceremony starts. That\"s when I receive a shock. I smell someone familiar, someone coming towards me. It\"s definitely... I spin around to see; I have gotten sensitive of anyone approaching me who\"s not Tallpoppy, the elders, kits or medicine cat. \"Hi, Tawnypelt,\" Rowanclaw meows. He is approaching me, but not in that usual cautious way, like I\"m the scum many in my Clan see me as. His expression suggests...friendliness? It\"s amazing enough that he had greeted me, but it\"s even more amazing that he\"s doing it of his own free will. Yet, I am still cautious. Did Blackstar distrust me so much that he had Rowanclaw watch me? Is this all a trick? Is he acting friendly so I could trust him and spend time with him? Is this a ruse? It doesn\"t seem so, but I wouldn\"t put it past Blackstar to have someone spying on me. Rowanclaw sits down next to me. I feel his pelt against mine. He is barely half a mouse-length apart from me. His pelt is...softer than I had expected and I flinch a bit from his touch. I shift aside a bit. I am wary now, so wary that I cannot stand to touch anyone, even if it is a slight brush of the fur. I know how much my Clanmates hate me, for my ThunderClan blood. It\"s an obvious fact. Rowanclaw doesn\"t bother to move back to me. I\"m slightly relieved. It doesn\"t feel right to be near him. Yet, I could sense something between us. I feel something drawing me towards him. I feel that I could trust him. He is acknowledging my existence. He isn\"t...shunning me. Something is telling me that Blackstar didn\"t hire Rowanclaw to spy on me. I look up and catch Blackstar staring at Rowanclaw and me with a somewhat disgusted look. I am suddenly convinced that Rowanclaw is offering to be my friend on his own free will. He is doing this because... Really? Is he...accepting me? I feel something like elation as the ceremony starts. Something brings me to him and before I know it, I move closer to him. He stiffens in surprise, but does not draw away. He merely seems surprised and I feel that surprise as well. I feel something inside of me and I am grateful to him for not shunning me. In that instant, I move closer to him and I sense that everything will be all right. I\"m putting my trust in Rowanclaw and - as he relaxes at our touch - I feel that we\"ll accept each other - I\"ll believe that he will not let me down. We\"ll be friends and we\"ll trust each other. Rowanclaw I feel sorry for her. Tawnypelt has proved herself a loyal ShadowClan warrior, despite her birth, countless times over. Yet, it\"s like she had never done any of her acts of valor. I especially saw through to her loyalty when she fought those kittypets. Those pieces of fox-dung killed my apprentice, Talonpaw, I lusted for revenge. I burned for it. That thirst for the blood of those pieces of carrion was overwhelming, it shrouded my heart. When Tawnypelt came back with help from ThunderClan, I was actually grateful that she cared so much, that she would tell another Clan. I was so intent on my revenge; Talonpaw had been the son I never had. Losing him was like losing my heart. Then, when Tawnypelt acted weak to lure the kittypets into our trap for them, I was shocked beyond belief. Tawnypelt was a proud warrior and formidable. She was willing to seem so weak for the sake of her Clan. Acting like that hurts pride. As I had watched her, I was convinced that she was loyal to her Clan, even though ShadowClan was not her birth Clan. After we had scared the kittypets off, I was shocked that nothing about her status changed. In Blackstar\"s eyes, especially, she was still half-blood trash. I was furious. I felt sorry for Tawnypelt; she did not deserve this horrid reputation just for something she could not control. She didn\"t choose her mother, her birth Clan, her father, her brother. She didn\"t choose those. She had no say at all. She had joined ShadowClan to be accepted for who she made herself. As I see her tonight at the apprentice ceremony for Applekit, Toadkit and Marshkit, I remember how she had hurt her own pride to help her Clan. I remembered how much I had wanted to kill those kittypets for hurting, killing, my son. Yes, Talonpaw was my son, not related by blood, but related by our bond. I realized that Tawnypelt felt that bond with her Clan, natural because they were her kin, simply because they were her Clan, even though nobody acknowledged her loyalty, her brave acts, everything she had done for this family of hers. The ceremony reminds me of Talonpaw\"s own apprentice ceremony. With that, I remembered everything and found deep appreciation for Tawnypelt. That is why...I will be her friend. PT: Please, I like to put up meanings that are hard to find. You\"ll need to delve deep! (Annoying singsong voice.) You\"ll need to think hard!! I really think ThunderClan\"s just way too perfect. ShadowClan is my least favorite Clan, but they do have emotions, opinions and the things that make them living beings. :) Please vote! I can\"t make promises about updates anymore. -Smacks self- Anyway, yes, I have realized that I have not double-updated, but I don\"t go back on my word.

Anyway, I got a little carried away in the last pairing, what with all the shunning, pride, acknowledgement and prejudice; I think Naruto has gone way past into my head OO\" I\"m serious, at the first episode, there was all that attention stuff, loneliness, existence, blah, blah, blah and I was like \"Hey! That\"s exactly how I feel!\" Naruto has reminded me of the honor and determination I learned when I was barely over seven years of age, so I\"m addicted to it. Darren\"s Wings Thanks! Fuzz is a kittypet and his owner is a vet, well, I think the owner\"s a vet. The owner healed Barley and his sister. Barley\"s sister is Violet and their brothers, Snake and Ice, were Scourge\"s personal guards. You can read about them in Secrets of The Clans. Allan pike I totally agree. Love should not be forbidden! ANGELA Hm, nothing implies a love interest yet, but I\"m out on watch for it! HOLLYPAW, FALL IN LOVE! Yellowfang I\"m dying... The black is pressing on me, splotches of darkness appearing in my vision, blurring the image of the tom before me. Fireheart...the son I never carried. He was always a better son than Brokentail. Brokentail, traitor, murderer, someone I probably should not call a son, but I still loved him, because he was my flesh and blood. Mine and Raggedstar\"s. I\"m dying, my life is flashing before my eyes, letting me see the story I have looked at with my gaze. Raggedstar...was a great cat. I loved him, truly, I did. He was brave, honest, a great leader whom I have known for as long as I can remember. I can feel it, sense it, horribly, my breathing is slowing down. It\"s harsh, raspy, grating, like drawing a claw slowly across a bone, sunk deep. I\"m going... If this is dying, it is not horrid. It\"s actually...comforting, knowing that your pain will end soon, you\"ll unravel and reach up into the skies. So, this is the end. I hear those whispers, achingly familiar, Raggedstar\"s whispers, being pushed into my head, gently, flowing like a steady stream and I suddenly feel Raggedstar beside me. He has flown down, into my presence, to welcome me into the Great Beyond, to help me there, gently, knowing that we could love each other there without breaking a code. I have told Firestar that I had killed my own son, let him know of what has haunted me for what seemed to be forever. There is no need to look at myself as I leave this world. I could tell that my fur is burnt, dulled and I know that things will be better in Silverpelt. It\"s just like that. I dearly hope that StarClan will forgive me for all my wrongs. All these jabs of pain, invisible puddles of ice-cold wate, regret and terror, the warmth in my heart at being able to see the son I have never been the blood of...brings tremors to the body I have always inhabited. It\"s horrid: Patchpelt and Halftail, both dead. StarClan, keep them. There is some sort of consciousness beside me, warm, tingling. I can feel it, materializing. I feel that sudden warmth beside me, blow on my fur, as if to blow off the soot. Raggedstar? Raggedstar! I could feel that sort of warmth that comes up suddenly. I hear... I feel...his presence. It cannot be explained unless one feels themselves. I don\"t know, I just hear him now... No, it\"s like thoughts but...I\"m conscious of everything around me. I\"m caught between two worlds: this place I have walked physically and my mind, a mental place of its own. It\"s like thinking...but I\"m not losing concentration on this physical world. Thinking... I\"ve always defined it as feeling thoughts, but I\"ve never found the words to explain it before. The world is strange that way. There\"s a heaving mass of energy in my chest now, all in my sorrow, remembering how I\"ve loved Raggedstar, but couldn\"t, how he was happy that I was carrying his kits, how I had to lose my daughters right at their birth, how I had to stand to see my son throughout his life but never knowing his kinship with me, seeing him become a monster, losing Raggedstar and then killing my only son. Fireheart helped me... He brought me to ThunderClan and I found a new family. I found two new kits who did not share my blood: Cinderpelt and Fireheart. Now, I\"m going to have Raggedstar back, dear Raggedstar. I feel the warmth coming over me, so comforting and I suddenly invite it, with all the warmth I could muster for it. I hear whispers...coming in my head... Raggedstar... I close my eyes, slowly, because I want to at least see this world one last time... I do not meet darkness, for the first time, upon shutting my eyes, and the last time. I could hear Fireheart\"s cries to me...but I ignore them... I hear the sound, but not the words. To bask in my true son\"s voice...one more time. Good-bye... \"Yellowfang.\" I can hear the voice, that voice of Raggedstar, replacing Fireheart\"s. I find myself standing up, feeling like the time I had become an apprentice for the first time. I\"m all right now. I could see my body, a useless lump of dark, but I could see Fireheart. I turn, tearing my eyes away from him in his grief to see my beloved. There he is, the one I have craved to see. Oh, he hasn\"t changed a bit. As always, he is there, proud stature, with his unkept gray pelt, his thin tail high in the air, his proud amber eyes that always gleamed. I purr, find myself doing so, knowing that he is there. I see him again. I can. He is there, my beloved and I find myself padding quickly towards him. To feel him again...to tell him how much I love him, to know that he loves me. Peace at last. It comes to me and we\"re together, this time, knowing that it isn\"t against the code and not having to break apart again. We are together... ... Forever... PT: Please understand this. I have tried to put lots of thought into it. Er... Oh damn, now comes the part where I explain everything when I\"ve always been horrid at putting things into words. -Rubs temples- Sorreltail: Don\"t hurt yourself!

Oh, yeah, I did have the time to write a new ONESHOT! It\"s for the Da Vinci Code, awesome book, no offense to any religions. I\"ve got no religion, so it doesn\"t hurt ME in any way, other than the fact that my divorced dad is Christian and I live across a Catholic church. Can someone tell me why Chinese people can\"t live in a home facing a church? I overheard it: some kind of superstition. It\"s got nothing to do with a graveyard, either. AHEM, well, to the point, now. Please read that oneshot! I\"m really proud of it! I know, it\"s just a fic, but I spent a whole night writing the draft. This is the first time I\"ve drafted a story OO\" Btw, people, what do you think of the people who constantly threaten people who write those \"ask\" fics for Warriors? I find it frinkin annoying. Sorreltail: Demi... -PT looks up at note- PT: Holy crap, that\"s a long rant. Darren\"s Wings Thanks again! OMG, I can\"t believe I forgot about Birchfall and Applekit! -Bangs head on table- Anyway, yeah, that fic on Katrina is brilliant! Love it! Silverstream So, this is StarClan\"s punishment. I\"m dead, now, but I can\"t believe it. I\"m dead. I repeat it, as if it\"s the only way to make it seem real. I\"m dead. No matter how much I repeat it, it\"s still unbelievable. How could StarClan do this to me? I love Graystripe, but I can\"t love my kits? I can\"t show them my love, be there for them? I stand here, with my mother\"s tail around my shoulders - all I do is stare at Graystripe, my kits, Fireheart, Cinderpelt and Tigerstar. Graystripe is wailing in grief at the body I have left behind. Oh, I so want to help him. I want to comfort him, but I keep standing my ground. It\"s the shock, the grief. I unconsciously unsheathe my claws and attempt to dig them into the incredibly hard rock beneath my paws. I want to feel this rock, feel the solid hardness, to feel it, reassure myself that, as long as I am touching the ground, that I\"m still here. Then, maybe I can comfort Graystripe. I want to stay alive. I want to watch my kits grow up, to see them become strong, fine warriors, maybe eben Clan leaders. Yet, most of all, I want to live to be with Graystripe. My claws scrape against this solid stone, not penetrating it. I insistently sink my claws in more. I grip the earth, because I don\"t want to leave - I can\"t leave. I can\"t leave! I CAN\"T LEAVE!! I DON\"T WANT TO LEAVE!! I can\"t leave! I don\"t want to leave! I don\"t want to die!! I don\"t! I DON\"T!! I WON\"T!! If I leave - if I die - who will take care of my kits? Father will be devastated! Mother\"s already died from blackcough when I was only an apprentice. I\"m the only family he has left. I can\"t just die and leave. He\"s my father. Crookedstar is my father and the only one I have left; I\"m the only one he has. I\"ll gain my mother when I join StarClan, but then my kits will be alone. They\"ll have no mother. Their father will be in a different Clan...if the kits won\"t end up as part of ThunderClan. Which Clan will they be part of? Why did I fall in love with Graystripe? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? WHY? WHY - did I fall in love with him? Why did he fall in love with me? Why did I? If I we hadn\"t loved each other, none of this would have happened. I wouldn\"t have carried Graystripe\"s kits. I wouldn\"t have to die - to leave the ranks of the living. To leave father. To leave RiverClan. Yet, what I mourn the most...is that I have to die and leave my love. My mate. My Graystripe. The handsome gray tabby, with those amber eyes that always glowed at me, always kind. Always the same amber eyes that held my gaze lovingly. Always. The eyes would always give me a deep feeling, penetrate me with a kind of warmth, a kind of love that penetrated, penetrated - penetrated me so hard - that it hurt. It killed me. Yet, I still invited that pain. I loved it. The pain told me how much I loved Graystripe. That pain hurt, but I loved it, hard. I loved it incredibly hard. I can\"t give it a name, but the pain came whenever I thought of Graystripe, and it hit hard. I invited it - I basked in it. It was probably love. Fierce love. A kind of love that was so painful in its own way, I loved it, that it was something good. A kind of pain that was good. A kind of pain that\"s not so painful at all."]}
{"id": "8e6c101b-8e98-5830-9f11-361d797a6b5c", "fandoms": ["Walker, Texas Ranger", "Boondock Saints"], "pair": ["\"Max,\" inquired Sam, \"are you going to come tomorrow, too?\" \"Wouldn\"t miss it,\" he responded. Then Jimmy called him over to his desk. \"Walker, do you have that item I asked you for?\" Sam queried. \"Right here,\" he rejoined as he handed her a large manila envelope that was stiff. \"I\"m still curious about what you\"re going to do with this.\" She just smiled and thanked him as she took it, then made her way toward Syd and Gage. Sydney\"s crutches leaned against her desk as she sat in her chair. She quietly watched the activities in the room with a pleased smile. \"Sydney,\" called Sam as she approached, \"I have an errand to run. Would it be alright if I picked you up in an hour or so?\" \"I have a better idea,\" put in Gage. \"How about you meet us for dinner? I\"ll bring Syd, and you won\"t have to come back.\" \"Sounds good,\" Sam agreed. \"Oh, Gage,\" interjected Syd, \"didn\"t you tell me this morning that you brought Max to work?\" Without giving him time to answer, she turned to Sam with as innocuous a smile as she could muster and asked, \"You wouldn\"t mind if he joined us, would you?\" Gage watched his partner, but said nothing. Sam eyed Syd and a slow smile crossed her face as she replied, \"No. That would be fine.\" They selected a restaurant and then she turned to go. \"What was that about?\" posed Gage quietly. He observed Syd watch the door close behind Sam, wait a few moments, and then call out to Max. \"What can I do for you, Sydney?\" he questioned as he approached. \"Gage and I are meeting Sam for dinner and wanted to ask you to join us,\" she stated. \"We can ride together to the restaurant.\" \"You sure I won\"t be butting in?\" \"Not at all, we want you to come,\" she assured him. \"Alright, sounds good,\" he assented. \"Let me know when you\"re ready to go.\" With that he returned to his desk. Gage looked at Syd with a grin and shook his head. \"You\"re so bad.\" \"What?\" she replied innocently with her own mischievous grin. Sam was waiting for them when they pulled into the parking lot of the Italian restaurant. Together they moved toward the front door. \"It\"s my turn to pay,\" called Gage just before they entered. Everyone acknowledged him. Shortly after, they were seated at a rectangular table with two chairs on either side. Sydney sat on Gage\"s left and across from Sam, who was to the right of Max. It wasn\"t long before they were enjoying their meal and talking amicably. \"You sure didn\"t bring much, for moving up here, Sam,\" stated Max. \"I\"ve learned to travel light,\" she returned with a smile. \"My trick is sending my luggage to my hotel ahead of me.\" \"Sam,\" queried Syd, \"how long are you planning to stay at the hotel?\" \"That depends,\" she responded. \"I\"ve purchased some property and my house is under construction. It\"s supposed to be completed within the next month. When it\"s done I\"ll move in, until then I\"ll probably be at the hotel.\" \"Why\"d you move up here if your house wasn\"t ready yet?\" asked Max. Sam paused before she answered. They could all tell she was weighing her words carefully. A shadow crossed her face and she began pushing her food around her plate with her fork. There was hesitation in her voice and she stared at her plate as she said, \"I just really needed to get out of Houston.\" The three Rangers exchanged glances. They could tell something was amiss, but knew better than to pry. Max decided to change the subject. \"So, Syd,\" he began, \"did the doctor say how long it would be before you can use your leg again?\" \"At least a week. Then I\"ll have therapy to help rebuild and strengthen my muscles. After that it\"ll all depend on how quickly I recover. He said I won\"t have full use for a good four weeks, maybe five.\" Here she looked at her partner before continuing with, \"So we\"ll be missing our workouts for awhile.\" \"You will,\" stated Gage. \"But Max offered to spar with me until you\"re back to 100 percent.\" \"Good,\" she replied with a sly grin. \"Maybe then when I come back you might actually be able to challenge me.\" \"No, what you mean is, there will be no way you will be able to challenge me.\" Their grins gave away the teasing nature of the exchange. \"So,\" put in Sam, \"you have all been trained in the martial arts?\" At their affirmative responses she further queried, \"What disciplines?\" \"I\"ve studied Tae Kwon Do since I was twelve,\" answered Gage. \"I was fifteen when I began taking lessons in Tang Soo Do,\" replied Syd. \"I practice Jiu Jitsu,\" responded Max. \"I started at six.\" \"Wow,\" said Sam. \"I imagine you\"re all very good at taking care of yourselves.\" \"We hold our own,\" rejoined Syd. \"But Walker\"s the best.\" \"What does he study?\" inquired Sam. \"Everything,\" retorted Gage. \"How about you, Sam?\" posed Max. \"Have you ever studied the martial arts?\" \"No,\" she replied. \"I\"ve always wanted to, just haven\"t yet. My daddy says you should never let someone get close enough that you need to fight with them, and so I\"ve been handling weapons my whole life. But I\"ve always thought self defense training could only be a useful skill.\" \"If you want I\"ll teach you when I get back to normal,\" offered Syd with a smile. \"When have you ever been normal, Shorty?\" remarked Gage with a playful grin. \"Gage,\" interjected Sam with curiosity etched on her face, \"why do you call her that?\" \"Well, first of all it fits,\" he stated matter-of-factly. Then he said, \"Ow,\" as he flinched at a smack on the arm from Syd. Max and Sam began to chuckle. \"Is there a secondly?\" pressed Max. Gage broke into a huge grin as he replied with, \"Because I can\"t call her sexy in the office.\" Max and Sam started laughing heartily as Sydney turned red and punched Gage hard in the shoulder. \"OW! Hey!\" he complained as he rubbed his arm. But he was unable to erase his smile, and could tell that she couldn\"t stifle hers, either. From there, the conversation devolved into more teasing between the partners, and eventually ran along general lines. The evening was pleasant and everyone enjoyed themselves. At the end, the boys left in Gage\"s car and the girls went back to the hotel in Syd\"s, with plans to meet the following day for the opening of C.D.\"s. To be continued.... Author\"s Note: Many thanks to those who reviewed the previous Chapters. I hope you enjoy Chapter 6. Chapter 6 Thursday morning Sam and Syd were awake at 7:00. Sam showered while Syd ordered breakfast. Just after she finished talking to room service her cell phone rang. She checked the Caller ID before she answered. \"Hey, Handsome,\" she said to Gage. \"How are you, Shorty?\" he responded. \"Did you sleep okay?\" \"Great. I feel much more rested than yesterday. How are you?\" \"Fine. I was wondering what your plans for today are.\" \"We\"ve got a hard day ahead of us,\" she replied sarcastically as a playful smile spread across her lips. \"I just ordered room service for breakfast. Sam has in room massages for both of us coming at 8:30. Then we\"re going to the spa for manicures and pedicures. You can see it\"s going to be a rough morning.\" \"Yeah. Sounds like sheer torture,\" he answered mockingly. \"What about lunch?\" \"I know we\"re going to C.D.\"s this afternoon to get ready for tonight. But so far we don\"t have definite plans for lunch.\" \"Let\"s hook up then. We can meet for lunch before you go to C.D.\"s.\" \"Good idea,\" she agreed. \"Anyone else going to join us?\" \"I\"ll talk to Walker and Trivette and let you know. Max and I are going to be partnered until you come back, so I\"ll just plan on bringing him.\" \"Tell Walker and Jimmy to invite Alex and Erika, if they\"re available. Then I\"ll ask Sam if Alex can help us at C.D.\"s this afternoon. I\"m sure she would love to.\" \"Sounds good. I\"ll call you around lunch then. You and Sam pick somewhere to go and let me know where to meet you.\" \"Okay. Talk to you then.\" Gage paused before finishing with, \"I love you, Shorty.\" Sydney smiled wide and replied, \"I love you back.\" Then they ended the call. About that time Sam came out of the bathroom and Syd shared her conversation with Gage. \"That\"s a good plan,\" Sam said. \"I would love for Alex to join us, if she wants to.\" With this the ladies began their day. Just after he hung up with Syd, Gage placed a call to Max. \"Hey, Max. Since we\"re working together and have stuff going on pretty much all day, how about I just pick you up and you can ride with me today?\" He paused as Max responded. \"Good. I\"ll be there in half an hour.\" Gage and Max entered the offices just after Walker and Trivette. The four men congregated around Walker\"s desk to discuss the upcoming day. \"Boss, I talked to Syd this morning,\" began Gage. He proceeded to share the pertinent information from their conversation. \"So you guys want to join us for lunch?\" \"Sure,\" answered Walker. \"I\"ll give Alex a call. I think she\"s been getting cabin fever. It\"ll be good for her to get out of the house.\" \"Let me call Erika and see if she\"s free for lunch,\" replied Jimmy. \"As far as I know we should be able to.\" \"Good,\" finished Gage. \"I\"ll let Syd and Sam know. By the way, Boss, what did she pick up from you yesterday?\" Walker smiled as he responded with, \"I\"m sure you\"ll find out when she\"s ready to tell you. Now let\"s get to work.\" With that the men dispersed. Everyone arrived in the parking lot of the steak house just after twelve. Sam had called ahead to let them know a large party was coming in, so they were seated promptly. Two tables had been pushed together to accommodate them. Nobody thought anything was unusual when Gage helped Sydney to sit down then sat next to her and draped his arm across the back of her chair. They talked amongst themselves as they ate. \"Walker,\" asked Sam, \"can I ask how things are going with Jeff and his friends?\" \"Sure,\" he replied. \"Since this is the first serious offense for any of them they\"ll be given the chance to go to Camp Justice.\" He explained about the program he developed to help young offenders turn their lives around and avoid hard time. \"Hopefully they\"ll learn some personal responsibility, and maybe interacting with some young men who have had a much harder life than they have will teach them to appreciate where they come from. If they don\"t succeed here they\"ll be facing prison.\" \"Sounds like a good opportunity,\" she responded. \"I sure hope he and his daddy can get things right between them.\" \"Have they had problems long?\" inquired Alex. \"Mrs. King passed away when Jeff was seven,\" Sam informed them. \"Mr. King took it hard and became very withdrawn. He realized too late how much Jeff was hurting, also. It went downhill from there.\" \"Perhaps this incident will give them the break they need to get back on track,\" put in Jimmy. They chatted some more on various subjects as they finished their meal. When the bill came they divided it up. Walker paid for himself and Alex, Jimmy took care of his and Erika\"s portion, and Max picked up the tab for the rest of them. \"I\"m off work at five,\" Erika said as they left. \"Shall we plan dinner for 5:30?\" Everyone agreed to that. Then Sam, Syd, and Alex, with Angela, headed for C.D.\"s and the rest went back to work. The ladies arrived at C.D.\"s just before two. Sam led them inside to find that her employees were already there beginning preparations in the kitchen. Sydney settled into a chair and Alex handed Angela to her, mostly so Syd wouldn\"t be tempted to get up and do too much. Sam pulled out decorations to put up all around and set the jukebox to play random selections. \"Alex,\" Sam stated, \"I have something I need to pick up. Would you mind getting started here? I should be back in about thirty minutes.\" \"No problem,\" replied Alex. \"Syd and I will manage until you get back.\" Sam left and Alex began asking Syd where to hang the decorations. They hardly noticed the time pass as they laughed and talked. Syd sat in the chair holding Angela and giving input on where to place things, and Alex would hang them on the walls or from the rafters. A short time later Sam returned with a large dry erase board and a wrapped package. She set both on the table in front of Syd and called Alex to join them. \"This is something special I wanted to put up,\" began Sam. \"Walker helped me get part of it, but you two are the first to see the completed product, so please let me know if you think everyone else will like it.\" As she spoke she removed the wrapping from the package to reveal what it contained. Sydney gasped and put her hand to her mouth. Alex choked up as tears came to her eyes. \"Oh, Sam,\" Alex said as she pulled out a tissue, \"it\"s wonderful. I\"m sure everyone will appreciate it.\" \"Definitely,\" joined in Syd. \"Thank you. It\"s beautiful.\" Sam beamed at their responses. \"I\"m glad you like it. I thought I would hang it behind the bar.\" She walked toward the spot she was planning to use. \"That\"s the perfect place,\" interjected Alex as she moved to the wall with Sam. \"What\"s the white board for?\" \"I\"m going to place it here for something fun,\" answered Sam as she positioned the board against the wall. \"Let\"s hang these up and I\"ll show you what I mean.\" As five o\"clock approached Sam surveyed C.D.\"s and was pleased with what she saw. She turned to Alex and Syd. \"Well, ladies,\" she began, \"it looks good in here. I say we unlock the doors and declare this place open for business.\" They chorused their agreement and she went to the door. Several people who had been regulars and heard about the reopening were waiting outside, and they entered with enthusiasm, admiring the decorations. Just before 5:30 Walker came in, followed by Jimmy, Erika, Gage and Max. Sam greeted them at the door and led them toward the bar where Alex and Syd, who was still holding Angela, were waiting. Their eyes went to the wall behind the bar, and everyone took pause. They immediately noticed a ten inch by thirteen inch picture of their old friend C.D. It was surrounded by a white matte, which had an inscription in calligraphy above and below the picture, and was framed in oak. The upper dedication stated: In Loving Memory of C.D. Parker. Beneath this were the dates of his birth and death. Underneath the picture was the caption: Respected Ranger, Faithful Friend. \"You did a good job, Sam,\" exclaimed Walker. \"So that\"s what you wanted the picture for.\" \"Thank you for including that,\" added Jimmy. \"It means a lot.\" \"Wow,\" was all Gage could get out. Gradually their eyes shifted slightly to the right of the picture where they saw the white board. They all read what was written there by Sam. It began with the heading: Quips, Quotes, and Sayings of the Wise. Beneath this was written: Yesterday is history; tomorrow is a mystery; today is a gift. That\"s why it\"s called the present. Author Unknown. \"I like that,\" remarked Jimmy. \"It\"s a cool idea,\" said Erika. \"How often are you going to change it?\" \"At least once a week,\" Sam informed them. \"I just thought it would be fun.\" \"It\"s good,\" commented Walker. Two tables had been pushed together near the bar for them. Walker took his daughter from Syd then kissed Alex. No one said a word about Gage greeting Sydney with a kiss as he sat beside her and clasped her hand. As they all settled in they looked around the room at the many flags and red, white, and blue streamers. \"I like the decorations,\" stated Walker to Sam. \"All the flags are fitting. I like how you\"ve hung examples of the older versions.\" \"The explanations that go with them are a nice touch,\" included Gage. \"Yeah,\" put in Jimmy, \"I never knew we had so many different versions or the history behind them.\" Then his eyes fell on the espresso machine. On the side was a large sticker that simply read Revelation 3:16. \"Sam, which verse is that in the Bible?\" She smiled as she replied, \"It\"s the one about, to paraphrase, \"be hot or cold, if you\"re lukewarm I\"ll spit you out\".\" Her friends laughed with her at that. \"So you think God likes coffee?\" continued Jimmy. \"Well,\" responded Sam, \"He did call his people the Hebrews.\" Groans went up from around the table at that. \"So, what do you have to eat?\" Walker asked. Sam began to share the menu with her new friends. As she neared the end she finished with, \"And I know that C.D. made famous chili. We also have that, though I\"m not sure how it will compare to his.\" She then went around the table taking everyone\"s order. \"I\"d like a Cobb salad and iced tea,\" Alex began. \"Sirloin steak, medium well, and potato salad with coffee, please,\" requested Walker. \"Let me have your chicken fajitas,\" added Jimmy. \"And fix me a tall, half-caf, skim latte, with no foam.\" \"Fried chicken, coleslaw, and lemonade,\" stated Erika. \"Chicken strips, fries, and a Coke,\" put in Syd. \"I\"ll have to try your chili with cornbread,\" said Gage, \"and a beer to go with it.\" \"I\"ll have the same,\" added Max. Sam smiled mischievously as she answered, \"First I need to see your ID.\" \"Aw, come on,\" they both began to gripe. \"What for?\" She just smiled as they handed over their badges. \"So that\"s what your first name is,\" she said as she grinned at Gage after studying his. Then, as she examined Max\"s, her eyebrows raised. \"Interesting.\" She handed back their ID\"s. \"Neither one of you uses your first name.\" She saw Max turn red as everyone looked at him, and then she smiled sweetly at him and went to the kitchen to place their orders, returning quickly. Their server came by a few minutes later with their drinks. At that time, Alex took Angela from Walker. She placed the sleeping baby in her carseat, and settled it on a chair at the end of the table. \"So what\"s your first name?\" Gage asked Max with surprise. Max looked askance at him. \"You first,\" was all he said. Gage sighed. \"Francis,\" he replied. \"Now you know why I don\"t use it. Your turn.\" \"Julian,\" responded Max. \"So where did \"Max\" come from?\" inquired Syd. \"That\"s kind of complicated,\" answered Max. \"My full name is Julian Maxwell Bowen, the third. PeePaw is Julian and Daddy goes by Maxwell. I was called Julian Maxwell, until I declared myself Max when I was ten.\" Everyone chorused their understanding. Sam chatted with them until they received their food. Then she made her way around the room to introduce herself and check on her customers. Everyone seemed to be having a good time. From across the room Sam turned to face the table near the bar and observed her friends. They were talking and laughing as they ate. Alex, Walker, Jimmy, and Erika had their backs to her, but Max, Gage, and Syd looked at her and smiled. Max indicated the empty chair to his right in a silent invitation to join them. She made her way over and asked how everything was as she sat next to him. \"This is really nice,\" commented Alex sincerely from across the table. \"C.D. would like what you\"ve done here,\" added Walker as he placed his left arm around his wife. \"I sure do miss Big Dog,\" put in Jimmy with a wistful smile. \"He was always one for a get-together. I\"m sure he\"s smiling down on us right now.\" The others nodded in agreement. \"Speaking of get-together\"s,\" queried Gage as he looked across the table at Jimmy and stretched his left arm across Syd\"s chair, \"what did you and Erika want all of us here for?\" Before he answered, Jimmy and Erika looked at each other and he slid his right arm around her shoulders. \"You all know, except for Max and Sam, that we got engaged a month ago. That same day, events took a nasty turn when Lavocat launched his revenge against Company B. First he shot Dan Jensen. Next, we found out he had murdered C.D. Then he blew up my car and almost killed me.\" Here he looked at Alex. \"You went into early labor, and Angela ended up in critical condition in the NICU. Finally, we discovered that Wade and Betsy Harper were both gunned down by his men in their home.\" He paused in his reverie as they all exchanged glances and contemplated the gravity of what those memories brought to mind. \"All that being said, we all know the risks we take with this profession. And we know how precious life is. Erika and I have been discussing it, and we don\"t want to waste any time we might be able to share together. So we\"ve decided to get married the first weekend in August.\" A chorus of congratulations of various sorts went up from around the table. Walker slapped his partner on the back and beamed at him. Gage stretched his hand across the table to shake Jimmy\"s, and then he turned a thoughtful gaze on Syd, who smiled lovingly back. Erika spoke up here. \"Alex, I\"d be honored if you would be my matron of honor. And, Syd, I want to ask you to be my bridesmaid.\" \"Thank you, Erika,\" replied Alex. \"I would love to.\" \"Me, too,\" added Syd with a smile. \"Thanks for asking.\" \"And, Walker,\" continued Jimmy, \"I would like for you to be my best man. Gage, I want you to stand with me, too.\" \"I\"d be glad to,\" answered Walker. \"My pleasure, man,\" responded Gage. \"Just make sure he doesn\"t get near the tuxes until the day of the wedding when you\"re all getting dressed,\" said Syd as she grinned from ear to ear. As everyone laughed, Gage tried unsuccessfully to defend himself and the story about him blowing up the men\"s tuxes and Jimmy\"s car right before Walker and Alex\"s wedding was shared with Max and Sam. The friends enjoyed being together, as they talked and laughed into the night. Roll credits.", "\"So, did I really fuck him?\" Runa looked concerned now. Darina started laughing \"What\"s so funny?\" \"That you actually fell for that. Murphy isn\"t the kind of guy that\"ll have sex with someone that\"s had more to drink then him, no matter how attractive she is\" \"What\"s that supposed to mean? I thought that both of them want you\" \"Yeah... I\"ve always been a lot more attracted to Connor anyway since he\"s a lot more levelheaded and actually knows when it\"s time to stop joking around\" \"So I can have Murphy if I want?\" \"Just be sure to let him approach you first... Irish guys tend to get uptight about things like that\" Author\"s Note: Sorry about not updating sooner, my muse decided to take a break... This chapter is here mostly to show what kind of person Darina has become since the brothers last saw her. Hope you enjoy! Don\"t worry, I\"m almost to the real story. Darina had convinced Connor and Murphy to help her move into her dorm room about a week before classes started and they were just getting the first load of her things unpacked when someone that looked slightly familiar came into the room. \"I know you from somewhere...\" \"Yeah, you\"re the bitch that slapped me at the club a few weeks ago. My name\"s Melissa by the way\" \"I\"m Darina and these two are Connor and Murphy\" \"Good to meet you I guess... I still say that you\"re not Irish. Those two may be though\" \"I actually lived in Ireland for most of my life, I just never had any use for the accent since my family\"s American\" \"Well... I\"m going to need to need the room to myself on the weekends so you\"ll need to find somewhere else to be.\" \"Why?\" the brothers noticed that Darina\"s eyes were narrowed and started turning that firey color that had always been their que to leave her alone. \"Well, my boyfriend is in a fraternity so I can\"t exactly go and stay there on the weekends, now can I?\" \"And what if I refuse to leave on the weekends? I live here too you know\" \"Then we\"ll have some serious problems now won\"t we?\" the brothers decided to go back downstairs to grab some more things. They knew how Darina when she was mad and they didn\"t want to be around when she blew up since they could end up getting hurt. When they finally got downstairs, they looked up to see that the upper half of Melissa\"s body was hanging out of the window and they heard yelling \"Look you fucking cunt! I\"m going to be living here too and we need to get a few things straight. One, I was the first one here so I get my choice of what half of the room I get. Two, I asked for a room where I could smoke so I\"ll smoke as many fucking cigarettes as I want. And three, I don\"t give a shit about your boyfriend. If you want to fuck him here, all you have to do is let me know... Don\"t go and assume that I\"ll willingly find somewhere else to sleep on the weekends.\" \"Whatever you want! Just let me go!\". The brothers looked at each other and started laughing \"I never thought that she\"d actually do anythin\" like that\" \"No shit. I jus\" thought that she\"d just knock her around a bit and leave it at that... Remind me ta never piss Dar off\" \"Yeah. I almost feel sorry for that girl\". As they started walking back inside, an elderly couple with a teenage boy came up to them \"Hello, have you two happened to run into Darina Cretarolo by any chance? I\"m her aunt Sandra\". The woman was almost as tall as Murphy and appeared to have aged gracefully. Connor couldn\"t help hoping that Darina would look like her in her older years. \"Aye, we\"re actually helping her move in... Wait, Henri? Ya grew up\" the boy looked at Connor and smiled. \"I was wondering when Dar would have you guys catering to her every whim again\". The boy looked exactly like Darina except for being well over six feet tall and having facial hair. \"Don\" know what yer talkin\" about. Me and Conn decided tha\" Dar should have some help getting this shite moved\" \"Right... How about we get up there and surprise her? She doesn\"t know that we\"re in town\" When all of them got up to Darina\"s room, they saw that she was unpacking the boxes without any regard to where she was placing her things. \"Where\"s your roommate?\" \"Hey Auntie, I actually got rid of my roomate... She and I had a few disagreements on how things would work around here so she decided to leave\". The brothers then ran to the window to make sure that Darina hadn\"t thrown her roommate down. \"Don\"t worry you guys. I wasn\"t actually going to toss her. I just wanted to teach her what happens when people piss me off\" \"I thought we talked about that Darina...\" \"Yeah, we did. I just decided that I didn\"t want to listen. Plus she was trying to tell me that I couldn\"t stay here on the weekends so she could fuck her boyfriend... and that was before she asked what my major is. Trust me Mitch, it\"s better that I have the room to myself. I\"ll actually be able to study rather than having to worry about people I don\"t like taking over my personal space.\" \"She does have a point Mitch\" \"I know, but I\"m still worried that you might take it too far one of these days Dar. I might be a good lawyer but there isn\"t much I can do if you kill someone\" At that point, Henri motioned to the brothers that it was time to go and finish unloading the truck. When they got back outside, Connor and Murphy looked at Henri. They wanted to know what was going on. \"I\"m actually not surprised that she didn\"t mention it to you... But Darina has some serious anger issues. The last time she got into a fight, the other girl\"s family ended up suing because she was in the hospital for over a month\" The brothers both looked shocked. \"How bad?\" \"Three broken ribs, a fractured collarbone, ruptured pancreas, and serious facial injuries... The chick ended up having to get a nose job just to be able to breath again\" \"Fuck! Does she get like tha\" a lot?\" Connor looked concerned and more than a little scared. \"That was actually about two years ago and even though Uncle Mitch and Aunt Sandra don\"t want to admit it, Dar had every reason to flip out on her... This chick was trying to get Dar to join a gang and told her that she was as good as dead once Dar said no\" \"So it was self defense?\" \"Kind of... Dar didn\"t mean for things to get so out of hand but she snapped once the chick told her that she she had killed Sheila\" Now Connor and Murphy understood. Sheila was the wolf that they had saved up for over a year as a present to Darina. Flashback \"Conn! Murph! Let\"s go look at the wolves!\" Darina had convinced the brothers to take her to the zoo. Now the exuberant nine year old was running around them in a dizzying display of energy. Connor and Murphy had been expecting this: Every time that they took her to the zoo, Darina would insist on going to see the wolves and trying to convince the zoo keeper to let her play with the cubs. \"Ya plannin\" on trying to keep one o\" them for yerself?\" \"No, I know better than to think that I could keep one... But it would be great if I could adopt a cub\" \"Well, come on then, maybe we can talk to the zoo keeper about tha\" When they got to the wolf sanctuary, the zoo keeper appeared to be waiting for them. \"Hey there Dar! I was wonderin\" when ye\"d be coming in! I\"ve got somethin\" special for ya\" \"Really?\" \"Aye. We\"ve got a litter here tha\"s been orphaned. The ma died durin\" labor an\" none o\" the other females are wantin\" ta care for \"em\" \"Are they still getting fed?\" Darina looked like she was about to cry. \"O course they are. I\"ve been feedin\" \"em meself an\" even though thier less than a month old, I\"m startin\" ta wean \"em\" \"What\"s going to happen once that happens?\" \"Ta be honest, I don\" know. They\"ve had too much human contact ta be livin\" with other wolves an\" the zoo won\" let me give \"em away ta anyone... Those damn greedy bastards. Their actually askin\" for five hundred pounds for each one... An\" tha\"s before the cost o\" gettin\" \"em fixed\" \"Why would they need to get fixed? I actually think that half wolves are beautiful\" \"Aye, but they can get nasty durin\" matin\" season and possibly kill someone an\" I sure wouldn\"t want ta have tha\" hangin\" on me conscience\" \"Can I see them?\" \"O\" course. Why would I have told ya about \"em in the firs\" place?\" He then led Darina and the brothers into a seperate part of the wolf exhibit where the cubs were and pointed out the orphaned litter before handing Darina a few scraps of raw meat for her to give them. After a few minutes, one of the cubs went up to her and started licking her face. \"Tha\"s strange. Tha\" one is the only one tha\" I was thinkin\" o\" keepin\" here. An\" now she\"s actin\" like a little puppy\" The brothers looked at Darina playing with the wolf that had taken a liking to her and decided that even though her birthday wasn\"t going to be for another month, they were going to be leaving with the wolf. \"I\"ll go an\" call her da so he won\"t be too shocked\" \"Right, I\"ll take care o\" everything else\" When it was time for them to leave, Darina hugged the little wolf. \"I have to leave now but I promise I\"ll come and visit you as much as I can before you leave\" \"The fuck ya talkin\" about? She\"s comin\" with us!\" Connor came up to Darina holding a collar and leash with a big smile on his face. \"You\"re kidding! You guys can\"t afford that!\" \"Which is why ye\"d better be grateful that we saved up so we could afford th\" perfect birthday present for ya. But don\" expect us ta be payin\" for the food or doctor visits\" Darina then grabbed the leash and collar out of Connor\"s hands while sticking her tongue out at Murphy. \"I don\"t expect you to pay for anything else Murph. My dad\"s a vet and I can feed her the guts from the slaughtered pigs. Maybe some of the stuff from the cows and goats too if my dad will let me\" \"Good ta know we\"ve got a smart girl. Right Murph?\" \"Aye, now let\"s get this smart girl an\" her wolf home before we spend any more money\" End Flashback Now Connor and Murphy felt disgusted with themselves. They hadn\"t even bothered to ask Darina about how Sheila was: They had just assumed that she was in California, happy and healthy. They also now realized that even though Darina was mostly still the girl they once known, so much had happened in her life while they had been apart that they weren\"t the large part of her life that they had been back in Ireland. Author\"s Note: I was thinking about giving more background before getting to the major plotline... But if I did that, this would end up being at least 50 chapters. So I\"m just going to jump ahead to the time of the movie after this, if you have any questions about the background that haven\"t been answered yet, ask if you don\"t get your answers in flashbacks that have yet to be written. It was now Saint Patty\"s and Darina was sitting at her desk, partially brooding and trying to get her homework done. Since the day that Henri had told the brothers about her \"outbursts\" as her family liked to call them, Connor and Murphy had backed off, saying that they needed to get to know her again. To say the least, she was pissed off. It had already been close to seven months and yet they still felt that they needed to keep their distance from her... Fucking hypocrites. If they even knew the true history of their family prayer, they would be thinking differently. She had already tried to explain this to them many times but her pleas for logic had fallen on deaf ears. And to make matters even worse, she was home alone on the biggest drinking holiday of the year simply because the fucking McManus assholes didn\"t want to risk her losing her temper. Never mind that they had seen her drunk before and knew that she was actually a nice drunk... Mostly because she was usually too focused on getting laid or getting some sleep to get pissed off at anyone. All of a sudden, Darina all of a sudden knew that something bad was about to happen. Ever since she had been little, she had been able to feel it when something tragic or life-altering was about to happen to someone that she cared about and she knew that this time wasn\"t going to be any different. Then her phone rang. The caller ID showed that Danny was calling and she immediately answered it. \"What\"s wrong hun?\" \"Damn... I don\"t even need to say anything\" \"You already know how this goes. Now spill it and tell me what I can do.\" \"Well... I kind of saw a mob killing. Or at least that\"s what I think it was. Someone followed me back to my dorm and I\"m pretty sure that they\"re still waiting outside.\" \"Don\"t go anywhere or talk to anyone. And I mean anyone, that you don\"t know well. I\"ll be over in fifteen minutes.\" She then started digging through her dresser drawers, trying to find something, anything that could help her. Then she found what she had been looking for in the back of her closet. \"Yes! I knew that Mitch didn\"t find it!\" \"What are you talking about?\" \"What do you think I\"m talking about? I found my katana. OW! And it\"s still sharp\" \"What... Why?\" \"I\"m not taking any chances hun. If they see me going up to your room and then see me leave, I become a potential target. Plus, anyone that threatens my friends is as good as dead, I don\"t give a fuck who they are.\" \"Shit... Just don\"t kill anyone Dar\" \"I won\"t unless they come after me first. I\"m not that stupid. I\"m going to hang up on you now. Be ready for me to get there in a few minutes.\" She then closed her phone and turned it off. If anything was going to go down, she didn\"t want to be given away by her phone ringing. After attaching the scabbard to her back and making sure that her katana was easily accessible through her coat, she grabbed her first aid kit and a change of clothes and headed out. After a few minutes, she was about a block away from Danny\"s dorm when she noticed someone hiding a few feet away from her. \"Shit...\" she thought to herself \"These bastards aren\"t taking any chances. This is going to be a bit harder than I thought\" She was barely able to keep her composure when she noticed that there were three men waiting outside of Danny\"s window. To only make matters worse, one of them was holding a baseball bat and all of them had guns. \"Fuck. I\"m going to have to sneak up on them... Why did this have to happen tonight?' She then started to walk towards them, trying to avoid attracting attention as she veered towards a clump of bushes where she dropped her backpack. She didn\"t want to get any blood on it. Luckily for her, she was able to jump towards the men right before they broke the window. She then cut through them in a splash of blood and a shower of body parts before they even knew what was going on.She had known that her sword was sharp enough to cut through several bamboo trees in one swipe but she had refused to believe before then that it could cut through human flesh and bone like soft butter... She felt like she was going to puke right as Danny opened his window... That wasn\"t too out of the ordinary, he had to have heard the screams. \"What the fuck! I thought you said you weren\"t going to kill anyone!\" \"That\"s what I said... Plans change, they were about to break your window open. I need to get out of here before the police come. I can explain the why but I don\"t think they\"ll believe any stories I could come up with about the how.\" \"What if anyone else comes?\" \"I\"ll deal with that if it happens, there\"s a sentry about a block away, I\"ll make sure that he follows me.\" With that, she ran to grab her things before running back to where she had seen the first mobster and ducking into a thick clump of bushes so she could change out of her blood soaked clothing. The man noticed her right as she was changing her shirt and started to approach her. \"Hey bella, what are you doing half naked in the middle of Harvard?\" \"That\"s my own business figlio ritardato di una femmina\" He jumped at her, throughly insulted only to meet the tip of her sword. \"And that\"s why I don\"t date Italians. You assholes never think to take a woman\"s insults literally\" She then finished dressing and took a garbage bag out of her backpack which she then put her blood soaked clothes in before heading back to her dorm. When she finally got back, she realized that her katana was still covered in rapidly drying blood. That also meant that the scabbard had a pool of blood in its tip. She took both items to the bathroom and started rinsing the blood off. When she was finally convinced that all of it had been washed off, she put both sword and scabbard back in her closet and grabbed the bag of clothes. She gagged a bit when she opened it but managed to keep herself from throwing up by focusing on finding the bottle of ammonia that she knew she had somewhere. When she made sure that all of the bloodstains had been covered with the ammonia, it finally hit her. She had just killed four men in cold blood and she still had the murder weapon in her room. There was no way that she was going to throw it out though. Her father had spent well over two thousand dollars on it as her birthday present for her 16th birthday, meaning for it to only be a decorative item, and she had spent almost as much in order to have it returned to it\"s original sharpness. Plus, it was far too unique of a weapon for it not to be traced back to her even if she did throw it out. She had no choice. She had to call Connor and Murphy. She quickly went through the numbers on her phone to find the one she wanted. Darina already knew that the brothers weren\"t at home. They went out drinking almost every night and Saint Patty\"s only gave them another reason to go out and get completely trashed. As she hit the call button, she hoped that Doc hadn\"t been given a reason to kick them out yet. \"ello?\" \"Hey Doc. Are Connor and Murphy still there?\" \"Aye, we\"re all here celebratin\" our v-v-... the boys won a good fight! Fuck! Ass!\" \"Hand the phone to Conn. I need to talk to him about something\" \"Hello. Who\"s this?\" \"Thanks Conn, you make a girl feel loved without even trying\" \"Hey Dar. What goin\" on?\" \"I need to to get over to my place as soon as you can... Something happened earlier and I really need your help...\" \"The fuck ya do this time?\" \"I\"ll tell you when you get over here. talking about it on the phone isn\"t a good idea. Can you get over here? I\"ll pay for the cab if you need me to\" \"This is some serious shit, isn\"t it?\" \"Yeah. It\"s finally sinking in and I think I\"m about to have a panic attack\" \"Shit, I\"ll be there in less than twenty minutes\" \"Thank you Conn. Are you going to bring Murphy?\" \"No fuckin\" way. He can barely stand up right now. I\"ll have Roc take \"im home\" \"Ok. See you in a few\" \"One more thing before I hang up. No matter what happened, remember tha\" I still love ya.\" \"Thanks\" When Connor finally got to Darina\"s dorm room, he quietly used the key that she had given him to open the door to the sharp stench of ammonia mixed with what seemed to be blood. He then noticed that she was curled up on her bed, shaking uncontrollably and sobbing. \"What happened Dar?\" \"I can\"t... I just can\"t\" He then sat down on the edge of the bed and started stroking her hair. \"Ya can tell me anything Dar. I\"ve been an ass these past few months and I\"m sorry for tha\". Please don\"t shut me out\" \"You were right about me Connor... I\"m a horrible person. Shit, I only did it to protect Danny but I could have done it differently\" \"I need ta know wha\" yer talkin\" about\" \"I killed four men Connor... Danny saw something that he shouldn\"t have and they were going to kill him. I did it in the worse way I could... There was so much blood\" \"Ya did good Dar. Ya protected yer own and ya made sure tha\" those bastards will never hurt another innocent\" Darina looked up at him, shocked for a second before she gave him a weak smile. \"Destroy all that is evil\" \"So all that which is good may flourish\" Connor finished for her. \"You\"ve been having the same dreams?\" \"Aye. I think tha\" Murph\"s been havin\" \"em too but he never wants ta talk about it. Maybe he thinks it\"ll jus\" pass eventually\" \"It\"ll never pass Connor. We\"re Shepards and our calling will never die. No matter what may happen to us. And it\"ll pass on to our children after we\"re gone. You should know this already\" \"How long have ya known?\" \"I don\"t know. I can\"t even remember a time when I didn\"t know. All I can say is that I felt that our destinies were being altered when you and Murph left. Maybe that\"s what pulled me into this\" Connor looked at her sadly and turned away from her. \"Let\"s talk about this another time Conn. Just grab the sword that\"s in the back of my closet before you go\" \"Aye. We\"ll talk in the mornin\" then\" As he walked out, Darina couldn\"t help thinking that finally things were happening the way they should. She had been waiting for years for her true calling to be realized and now it was finally happening. Now her best friends... Her soulmate and his brother were finally with her again. She felt her heart skip a few beats as she thought about what the future might bring. figlio retardato di una femmina: retarded son of a bitch Author\"s Note: This is not what I thought it would be.

Ice-cold talons clutched at me, dragging me to death. \"Hoole,\" I murmured as I left. I was sure that no one heard me, but I wanted him so much. It never will be. Oh, Hoole. As I disappeared forever, as I was dragged into the dark, a last thought escaped me. Hoole. \"Is she awake yet?\" Twilight muttered. \"No, not yet,\" Coryn replied. He touched the unconscious owl\"s face with a wing. He waited for her to stir. PT: Yup, that\"s all for now. I know, short, but the chapters will gradually grow bit by bit. I warn you, I have a happy talent for evilly placing cliffies down, as past readers have noticed. -Grins evilly- Nothing, Yet A Love Never Dying PT: I came back from Canada earlier this week. So, I decided to update! :D Unfortunately, I was signed up for a crap house that calls itself a summer school. With the amount of homework we\"re given, updates may be slower than usual. But I\"ve pretty much got this story planned out. I just need to decide on the amount of chapters this fic will have. FlamingSerpent MINE TOO! :D technologychic29 Yup :) Thanks. The Demonic Fox Yes, there will be four significant pairings in the plot: LuttaxHoole, LuttaxCoryn, CorynxKalo, and EmerillaxHoole. Some of the stuff is going to get angsty. Real angsty. Who Are You? \"Coryn! She\"s waking!\" Soren hooted. The unconscious owl before him shifted slightly, stirring. \"Finally!\" Twilight rolled his eyes as the Band and Coryn joined the Barn Owl. \"We\"ve waited for three straight days!\" \"I know!\" Soren replied, and shifted aside to let the others into Coryn\"s hollow. \"Tell me again,\" Gylfie said as she let Coryn get in front of her, \"why we\"ve waited for this one owl to stir?\" \"Because,\" Coryn said -- the unconscious owl shifted again -- \"I think she\"s...Lutta.\" \"She is a hagsfiend,\" Gylfie agreed. \"Definitely. But why do you think she is Lutta?\" Coryn gave a puzzled shrug. \"I don\"t know,\" he replied honestly. \"It\"s just something my gizzard tells me...\" \"You must be the only one with a sensitive gizzard then,\" Twilight put in, half joking, \"I don\"t feel anything at all. I think a certain Burrowing owl has...\" Coryn twittered slightly. \"Yes, turned it on.\" The five owls twittered with Coryn for a moment. \"Where\"s Otulissa?\" Twilight added. \"Hunting, I\"m afraid,\" Soren answered. \"Racdrops!\" Gylfie gave Twilight a nudge for his curse. \"She\"ll kill me for not telling her to come when the owl wakes up!\" '\"Well, we must all face her wrath later,\" Soren churred. \"Look!\" Coryn beckoned with his wing, and the others followed it. \"She\"s awake!\" I wonder...who are you? As I stirr, I can see shapes. Shapes? Owls, apparently. Who are you? What do you want with me? As I open my eyes -- have I been sleeping? -- I can see them staring at me. What is that expression on their faces? Twigs and something soft touch my being, the twigs crackling. I\"m in -- a nest? These owls, their sillhouettes are huge in my eyes. Is Hoole among them? Is Emerilla? Or -- my gizzard, be it real or not, gives a jerk -- even Strix Strumajen? But no...it can\"t be... My blurry eyes can see no spots -- none that are the ones blurring my vision. But blinking helps. Perhaps. I blink once, on this impulse. Then again...again...harder... Yes, blinking clear the spots of light in my sight. Once...twice...three times. Thrice. I blink a little more, a little harder, as my eyes start clearing up. By now, I can see -- a Barn owl...two, actually... There\"s a Burrowing owl, naked legs outstretched. There is also a -- I blink my eyes a little more, trying to focus them -- a small gray owl. I focus a little more, trying to focus more. It\"s an Elf owl. No wonder I had trouble seeing it; so small. There is one final one; I turn my gaze to him. I squint, but he\"s hard to see. I focus some more. It suddenly strikes me as curious; these owls are not saying anything. I lift a hooked talon, trembling -- quivering with caution. \"Who--\" I try to whisper, say something -- anything at all -- but my throat is dry. Invisible sand is stuck there. More alarmingly, I notice that the owls still aren\"t saying anything. Are they real at all--? No, they\"re warm. They\"re warm with the heat of life. None of them are cooling. I can feel it, from here, in this nest -- while they\"re standing a little ways around me. I try not to shrink back -- to look weak right now might provoke them to treat me roughly; I don\"t know if they are friend or foe yet -- as I already know that there is one of me, and more of them. I discover that they are now surrounding me. Suddenly, they\"re moving. Now, I really shrink back, as the Barn owl -- the smaller one, perhaps younger -- suddenly hands me a nut cup of some fluid. I don\"t know why, but I am suddenly taking it. Perhaps it is impulse. \"Drink it,\" the owl says kindly; he is a male, from the voice. \"You can speak.\" But...but -- but! -- I am a hagsfiend! Can they see that? I quickly glance down at my wing, not wishing to stare too long if I am to see the ugliness that Hoole had always detested. I force back tears as I see the thing I don\"t want to; nor ever want to see again. Long, dark sweeping feathers. Ragged. Intact, but with no visible half-hags. That is an improvement, but only slight. I am clearly a hagsfiend. They should hate me. As I look up again, the young Barn owl\"s eyes meet mine. And a strike of lightning buries itself into my heart. Those eyes...they\"re Hoole\"s! They are Barn owl eyes, pitch-black, dark without a trace of yellow. And yet...those eyes. They are Hoole\"s eyes. They gleam with kindness, justice. \"Go ahead, Lutta.\" Say my name again. Please! It sounds so sweet; you are acknowledging me! Only me! And you are being kind about it! You know me! Without another word, I swig down the nut cup\"s -- still clutched in my claws; liquid yet untouched -- contents. The sweetness of the juice, I have tasted it before. What, but I cannot remember? But, I must remember... But the sand in my throat is gone. I can speak clearly now -- hopefully. \"Wh-Who...are you?\" The question that I need to know the most right now. Who are you? PT: Yes, well. Lutta was so distracted by Coryn\"s eyes that she didn\"t really suspect the milkberry tea. Or anything, for that matter. I\"m hoping to keep this nice and slow :) I need to explain why she starts loving Coryn and everything. Please review. Nothing, Yet A Love Never Dying PT: I don\"t know if you count this as late or what, but thanks for the reviews! :D If I find the right time, I\"ll update the chapter after this :) Like, some time this month? Don\"t really ount on it, though. I\"ve started school this Tuesday, and I\"ve got to be a bit more serious because I\"m having my high school exams -- and I\"m taking tennis on Sundays. I turned 13 last month :) It feels weird; I\"m a teen at last... Anyways, yeah, I\"ll be busy...though I might find time, not sure yet... FlamingSerpent Heheh, I\"m happy :) Thanks! Ori-hime-Shinigami01 Glad you like it :D I\"ll try to! :3 Pinefur of DragonClan Lutta is AWESOME :) Lara-van :D! Thank you! Eater of Crayons Thank you ;) Same opinions here. I was SO mad when Strumajen killed Lutta xO These Fading Memories An unpleasant silence fills the air; it does not lift. The owls all look uneasy. I can\"t wait for an answer. What are they, waiting for a feather to float from the treetop to the ground until speaking? I shift a bit, warily letting my eyes dart from one owl to the other -- but my eyes are trained on the Barn Owl the most. Like Hoole...so like Hoole... He turns a bit, and our eyes meet directly. I can\"t describe it...in this next moment, I don\"t look away, how awkward it seems. I stare into his eyes. They\"re like Hoole\"s... They are Barn Owl eyes, but Hoole\"s eyes. They\"re his eyes...Hoole\"s eyes... They hold that light of valor, justice, that one glow that I always made me feel my gizzard twitch in the bottom of my heart. Hoole... He never wanted me, did he? He loved me, but only who I was pretending to be. He never loved me, only Emerilla...lucky owl. I just wanted to belong -- because I was nothing -- and he gave me that. He was so fair, so kind...he gave me something even Kreeth could not. Mum and Da -- Ygryk and Pleek -- were supposed to be my parents. I was supposed to be their chick, Lutta. Yet they left me. They talked about me behind my back...I was a freak. My own parents loathed me. Oh, they tried, but they left in the end. They didn\"t love me. Kreeth used me. No one really loved me, or even looked at me normally. All I was was a freak, nothing at all. Then he came along. Him, Hoole. The only one who let me belong, looked at me with kindness in his gaze, not looking like I was a...monster... Why was I born? Not one person cared about me. I was just freak my parents didn\"t want, a weapon for auntie\"s uses, and a fake to my only love. He cared, but didn\"t know me. In the end, I was a monster to him too. Now I\"m back. And now I wonder... I suddenly stiffen as I think up to a thought. \"What happened?\" I shoot up and stare into those kind eyes. I trust him to answer. \"Please, who are you? Where am I? Where\"s...Where\"s\"--I choke up, but the question is already on my tongue--\"Hoole?\" My talons clench as the name leaves me. At once, I see sympathy clearly written over their faces. A pang enters my heart. Sympathy for me? A nothing? \"Lutta.\" Sweet words again, and I suddenly wonder how this Barn Owl knows my name. \"It\"s hard to explain, but please...\" \"Listen carefully.\" Everyone, including me, jumps as the Great Gray speaks -- in a rather booming voice -- for the first time. The Elf Owl frowns at him. The older Barn Owl gives him a quick nudge. Words tumble from the young Barn Owl\"s beak. \"Lutta, we read about you in legends. It\"s been a long time since you were... \"Well, you\"re at the Great Ga\"Hoole Tree, and it\"s been a long time since you were...\" His voice dies down as he hesitates. \"Dead,\" the older Barn Owl finishes. He says it with that sympathy shown in his eyes. \"It\"s been thousands of years from your time, and we read about you from some legends about some...events...\" He clears his throat, determined to go on. \"Coryn here\"--a gesture at the young Barn Owl--\"is the king. I\"m his uncle, Soren. This is Gylfie\"--a gesture at the Elf Owl, who nods in greeting--\"Twilight,\" the Great Gray, \"and Digger\"--what a funny looking Burrowing Owl. \"My uncle and his friends are called the Band,\" Coryn adds. I let this newfound information seep in. Thousands of years? Could this be possible? I was dead, right? It\"s been so long -- and...I was dead? How...? \"I have a GIZZARD!\" \"You do not have a gizzard, you fool! you idiot! I created you.\" \"You created me, but I created this gizzard!\" \"No!\" What is this? \"Emerilla?\" He turns as I change. He knows now...what am I to do? Dismay spreads through my body. He\"ll probably think I\"m a freak too, and he\"ll hate me. But I love him! In the next second, I\"m flying at him. Adrenline floods me as I feel...am I losing myself? This gref... He\"ll hate me now. I slam into him, and he flies backward. \"I love you!\" I want to scream. I want to scream those three words. To let him understand. I want to scream, \"I love you!\" Then, an enexpected blow to the back of my head. Pain. Unexpected pain. Then talons, stopping me in my tracks. Talons...digging into me, slashing everywhere. My vision spins to red. I\"m being ripped apart at the seams. Torn. No... Why are you...? I sink, and I fall apart, literally. My feathers fall off, as my body becomes a lump of darkness. A lump of feathers. I truly am nothing... You\"d expect a real body when one is torn by claws -- and yet...feathers only. My phantom gizzard lurches. \"Half-hags!\" \"I had to kill her.\" WHY? \"She pretended to be my Emerilla.\" Is that all! I\"m going to die like this! Just because I was an imposter! \"I knew from the start that something was not right about her. A blood deception she was -- a hagsfiend.\" Anger -- hot, seeping rage enters me. And cold feelings. Feeling that make me want to shed tears. \"No!\" I manage. \"Who are you?\" Who? Hoole...you accept me as someone? Hoole... \"I am nothing...and yet, I loved...\" I loved... \"Lutta?\" \"Hey! Are you all right?\" \"What\"s wrong? Lutta!\" I sink down as my mind spins. Then, I black out. All was dark except for the fluttering movement of wings -- brown wings. A Barn Owl shifted in the branches of the magnificent tree, her dark eyes gleaming as she looked into the hollow. How strange that she could get so close to the tree so easily. She was but a sillhouette against the branched skies. She eyed the hollow, and the inhabitants. Her son...too bad she would have to kill him. He would have made a fine pure owl, had he not inherited his uncle\"s stupid softness. She could just kill him, right there and then. How easy, that everything she had been working for for the last few months would just be completed now, so easily. She could easily snatch the ember, then swoop in and kill Coryn, his disgraceful uncle, and get her dear mate\"s -- rest his soul -- revenge. Then, kill those pathetic owls that were always around Soren, and anyone else she comes across in the tree, just for a bonus. It would be wonderful to see their pained, stupefied faces as she sank her claws through their feathers, one by one. Then she saw the hagsfiend, and her eyes widened in horror. I am the last! How is this possible? Why is she in that hollow! She could just kill her as well -- but her eyes caught something, and her gizzard twitched. No...she\"ll just stay back and observe. This hagsfiend could prove some use to her and... Sadistic impulse shot through Nyra\"s gizzard. The adoring gleam in the hagsfiend\"s eye as she stared at Nyroc. No, she\"ll wait. Nyra silently spread her wings and swooped into the night sky. She had plotting to do. PT: Please, enjoy :) I hope I can fill up some holes in the story as soon as I can. Though, they\"re there for suspense. Please review! Nothing, Yet A Love Never Dying PT: THANKS SO MUCH FOR READING, EVERYONE!! Enjoy! I have a little more to say: I know the last book already came out, and I\"ve finished it already. I\"m a little stunned, but in courtesy of those who have not yet finished it, I won\"t spoil it. However, despite the end, I\"m continuing the fic the way it is. I\"ve just noticed how much I\"ve been neglecting the story O.o Anyways, I was rather...displeased with a few stories stuck in the GoGH fandom, and while I was planning to leave it after finishing this fic, I might a few more fics for this. Not that I have hubris...I just...don\"t know...I just think I\"ll contribute to the fandom with a few fics of angst :D Anani Mouse Thank you, thank you so much :D -Head swells- Frosted Fate Yeah, poor Lutta D: Wish Hoole ended up with her. One of the Populace Oh...-sobs- Hi! :D FlamingSerpent Thanks! I\"m flattered x) True, Nyra\"s so important to the plot -- being sadistic and plotting revenge, among other things :) Hawkrain I\"m glad you\"re eager :D Thanks for reviewing and liking it! :) Lara-Van Thank you, thank you -bows- X) It\"s great that you think that; cheered me right up ;) The Great Tree I can make them hurt... My Mum and Da. I can make them feel the pain that they\"ve put on me. They can hurt, and I\"d be able to do it to them. A change in our positions is want I want so badly, and they\"d taste the bile they stuck in my throat. They left me...they left me, their chick Lutta. Theirs. I have the power now -- to make them hurt. I can make them hurt. I can make them hurt... \"Lutta!\" Stop slapping me. \"Lutta, wake up!\" Slap. Stop slapping me with your wing, it stings. Slap. Slap. \"WAKE UP, Lutta.\" Slap. Slap. Stop it! I\"m trying to-- \"Lutta, please!\" ...Hoole? Hoole\"s voice! I flick my eyelids open -- all four of them -- at the same time. Hoole? No, it\"s Coryn. Just Coryn. \"Lutta, are you all right?\" The way he looks at me...it\"s like Hoole. So much like Hoole. \"I\"m fine,\" I answer, and immediately scan my surroundings. Perhaps I have become overly paranoid with time, but I can\"t be sure. In any case, I can\"t let my guard down in this case; I could find myself dead in a second, just like that I died in an instant -- killed by Strix Strumajen. I shudder, remembering the memory of being ripped. Ripping, ripping, tearing, blood, pain-- Death. And then... Well, I don\"t want to think about what I don\"t remember. After that, there was nothing but a cluster of memories of what happened within death-- Falling. Falling... Floating...unraveling...flowing through the winds...becoming one with nature...then falling.... Falling, falling downwards, a curse uttered upon my kind: \"To hagsmire.\" Hagsmire, where the ones who have sinned within their lives went, for eternal damnation. Hagsmire, for hagsfiends, and...and... Nothings. Nothings -- they who mean nothing to the world, who should never have entered this life, this realm of breathing. Falling, agony, curses, darkness, cold hate. Those flaws of what life and death decide. And nothings. Nothings, like me. Nothing. Snap out of it. I don\"t want to remember. Of being one of the damned. And now I\"m back. Why? \"Lutta?\" -- and I look up. Hoole -- no, Coryn. Coryn, the Barn Owl. Unconsciously, I stare at him with huge eyes that deserve to pop out of their sockets. \"Yes?\" I say. Oh Coryn, please don\"t look at me like that. You look like Hoole, please, don\"t look sympathic...please don\"t...I want it but you don\"t have to give it. Can you not see that my heart has already been broken? \"Lutta,\" he says, softly, and gives me a tender nudge with his wing. \"Can you stand?\" I nod, because I cannot find myself shaking my head. \"Yes.\" Can my legs work? He steps back slightly, to give me room, and I try to remember how to use legs again. Now, I just...position them...and push upwards... A searing pain. My legs! They hurt! They hurt! Fall down again -- No, I can\"t. I can\"t fall; I\"ve told Coryn that I will stand, will be able, and I will not lie; not anymore; I have already lied and tricked Hoole, I will not do so again, not to any owl. Nor this owl. This owl, who stares with the eyes of a true king. A young king, but a wise one, and a good one. With difficulty, I stagger forward, out of the small nest. I feel the bark underneath my claws as I step on it; bark again, how it brings back thoughts of those days. It feels a bit unfamiliar, but I cannot forget bark. Such a thing is pathetic. I feel my legs quivering, wanting to give way, but no. No. I have said that I will stand. How they quiver! -- stop it. Stop quivering! I have said I will walk, and I will walk, even if this pain continues -- like fire searing at me, numbing in a way. I will not lie again. Deception has torn me once before; never again. I look at Coryn, see the concern in his eyes; he hesitates to step forward, wanting to help. No, I can do it. Please. Let me. I walk, a little faster, wanting my legs to stride. They work, a little better. I look at Coryn again, and I ask, \"Where am I?\" \"The Great Ga\"Hoole Tree.\" Silence. My breathe hitches quickly. \"The...\" I pause, mind spinning and reeling. The Tree? The Great Ga\"Hoole Tree, that was reigned over by...Hoole? \"Tree?\" The Tree. The Great Ga\"Hoole Tree. And my mind explodes. \"Th -- Then!\" I jump as I begin stuttering. \"The Ga\"Hoole Tree! I -- I don\"t belong here! I am nothing! I lo-- \"Hoole, he...NO! I am a disgrace! My presence is dirtying this tree!\" I back away, seeking some sort of exit. I don\"t belong here. No. I am defiling the Tree. How long has it been since the last time I was here? I deceived the good king, I nearly killed him -- he was a great king, and a great owl! I don\"t deserve to be here! How many good owls reside in this tree now, the Tree that was grown by -- as rumor says -- the sorrow and goodness of Hoole? I don\"t belong here! Coryn jumps now. Please, no! \"Lutta!\" he says, eyes flashing with some sort of fire that started. \"You are not!\" Not? But...Hoole! Hoole! -- please no! You--! I stare, transfixed, as I see Coryn change. I don\"t see Coryn anymore. I see...you. Hoole. Eyes, eyes that spoke of what you believed in. Your sense of love for those close to you, your fiery will that would see indiscrimation to the very end. I\"m sorry Hoole! I deceived you! I am everything you are not! -- and should not be! I am NOTHING! I back away, seeing Hoole. He steps forward, that look in his eyes-- \"You deserve to be here! You--\" I stumble backwards as I shriek, \"Hoole! Don\"t! Don\"t you understand!\" Now is my time to confess! I never told him that I was-- I\"m sorry Hoole. I\"m so sorry! \"Lutta!\" The owl before me is -- He\"s pleading! No, I don\"t deserve it! \"Lutta, you do! Just as any owl!\" My gizzard throbs, beating against its surroundings. I stare upwards, feeling it grow cold. \"NO! I DON\"T DESERVE TO BE HERE! I AM NOTHING! I -- DO -- NOT -- BELONG -- HERE! I AM...\" My gizzard gives a jerk. My throat fills with pebbles; \"Nothing....\" My words are choked. It\"s true. I am nothing. I don\"t deserve to be here, at the Great Tree. PT: Like? Hate? Please review. I hope to update soon. Fill up the plot holes, twist the story...you know. Nothing, Yet A Love Never Dying PT: I really need to update more often. xD -Shot- ...-looks out window- Well, I thought I\"d take some advantage. Now that I\"m in high school, and in the JROTC program, I\"ve joined the drill team that saps up all the members\" time. But as of this month practice has been cancelled until further notice. Now I have the energy and time for writing, so yeah -shrugs-", "got the Yang yoyo.\" Kimiko pulled the other half out of her pocket. The two dragon warriors placed the two halves together. Omi took it and handed it to the Brazilian Wind dragon. \"Raimondo, will you do the honors?\"Raimondo took the Shen Gong Wu with a grin. \"With pleasure...\" he said. \"YIN YANG YOYO!\" Please review! I\"ve only had a couple so far. PT: Chapter 2 is up! I\"d like to thank firecracker-girl and xxFireWarriorxx for their reviews. I will try to write this chapter with more detail. To answer xxFireWarriorxx\"s post script, this fic will be something like a movie, but there will be something in their future lives I made up, if you know what I mean. Enjoy! The silence in the Yin-Yang World was unnerving. In the prison, prisoners were only just settling back into their gloomy silence, after their little spell with the monks. They had been silent for a long time 1500 years ago, but only about a year ago, they had been aroused as the Chi Guardian had left with the Xiaolin Monks. Chi had been stolen and placed in the Yin-Yang World. An inmate, a certain bean who has never heard of toothpaste, escaped by means of the monks and a little evil wannabe who still sleeps with a nightlight and fears toilets. At last, there was something the prisoners could actually think about. Only, it had been what seemed like an eternity since there was anything new. For the Chi Guardian was returned, the monks didn\"t need to return and no more Shen Gong Wu were brought there, meaning that no more Silver Manta Rays could explode in midair. Today must have been blessed, as suddenly, a portal opened up in midair. Before you could say \"O.o\", the giant, 40-foot dragon by the name of Dojo stopped flying in midair as the portal closed...and fell. \"AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\" the monks (and Dojo) screamed as they fell towards the Yin-Yang World\"s cloudy ground. \"Remind me next time that Dojo can\"t fly in the Yin-Yang World!\" Raimondo yelled at Omi. \"Shut down Raimondo!\" Omi screamed, \"It is you who are leader!\" \"You\"re the smart one! Besides, it\"s \"shut up\", Omi!\" \"Incoming!\" Dojo yelled. As the dust cleared from Dojo\"s vveeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrry smooth landing, the Chi Guardian awakened... \"Look at all the pretty stars,\" Dojo mumbled as he got up, now back to his \"gecko\" form. \"Oof!\" Raimondo gasped as he tried to get Clay off of him. Omi and Kimiko got up and dusted themselves. Clay carefully got up and backed away from Raimondo, rubbing his back. \"Well,\" Kimiko commented nonchalantly as she watched Raimondo crick his back, \"So much for the almighty leader.\" Raimondo glared as he stood up. He opened his mouth to say something, but Dojo cut him off. He twisted into weird shapes and spun around desperately. \"Hurry UP!\" he shrieked, \"This Wu gives me measles.\" (Crickets chirp) The monks stared for a real long time. Then, in unison: \"EW!!!!!\" A While Later... \"I think the Wu is in the prison,\" Kimiko said thoughtfully. Raimondo blanched, but his head chanted the same thing. Prison...Prison...Prison... \"Absolutely! I say we go over to the prison, take the Shinobi Star and blow this taco stand.\" Raimondo declared, trying not to look at Kimiko. \"They have tacos here?\" Omi asked stupidly. Raimondo wanted to strangle himself. Clay slapped himself and Dojo sweat-dropped. Kimiko stared. \"Huh?!\" Omi looked completely clueless, that cute little cheeseball. The rest of the monks shook their heads and decided to leave that question unanswered. \"Let\"s go,\" Raimondo said and then started in the direction of the prison. The rest of the monks shrugged and followed him. They haven\"t gone more than 5 yards when, out of nowhere, a stand just appeared. The monks screamed, then stared at the sight before them. The stand was all yellow, with a giant sombrero on the top. The sombrero was yellow as well, with zigzags, green and red, around the spot sombreros usually have zigzags. On the front of the stand, a giant steaming taco bore the sign, a giant, neon red sign: FREE TACOS Omi yelped in delight. \"There really are tacos here!\" he squealed. The taco guy in the stand stared. Not really becoming of a Shoku warrior. Omi rushed up. He didn\"t have any breakfast today, being woken up by Dojo at 4:54A.M. for the new Wu. The monks followed him silently, too stunned to speak. \"Two tacos please!\" Omi said excitedly. He squinted at the menu next to the taco guy. \"Chicken tacos! Parrot style!\" Omi beamed. Omi happily chomped on his taco as his friends stared at him. Dojo exploded from his spot on Clay\"s hat. \"SHEN GONG WU!!!!!!!\" There was another shriek from our favorite cheeseball. He lifted his head. There, clamped between his teeth was a blackish silver shurikan, its four sharp points gleaming. \"The shurikan star!\" Raimondo yelled, plucking the star from Omi\"s mouth. Kimiko made a face. \"Yes!\" Dojo yelled, obviously relieved that measles won\"t start randomly coming out of his scales. \"Let us suck this taco stand!\" Omi yelled triumphantly. (Crickets chirping) \"Uhh...yeah...right...\" Kimiko muttered. \"LET\"S BLOW THIS TACO STAND!\" Raimondo yelled, ignoring Omi\"s scream of \"That too!\" Raimondo took the Yin-Yang Yoyo from his pocket. \"Yin-Yang Yoyo!\" As the newly made Shoku warriors left the inky kanji world, the prisoners were sure they\"d be bored again. No one thought they\"d returned again, that the unthinkable would happen as evil started to grow inside one of the monk\"s hearts. TO Be Continued... PT: Right, a cliffhanger at last! Hope you like the next chapter, when there will be more action! Including SHOKU POWER! Yay! Please comment! PT: Chapter 3 is up! I have a slight writer\"s block so some suggestions would be welcome. Plus, owing to the fact that I may be one of the youngest writers on fanfic net (I\"m not sure. I\"m 13; really), I have a State Test next week, so updates will have to wait awhile. There\"s going to be a fight scene in here, but I\"m bad at those, so please don\"t kill me! I\"m sorry! Anyways, enjoy! It was like any other day. Master Fung hadn\"t called the monks in for training yet and the monks had finished their chores. So the warriors were sitting around. Kimiko was playing Mindcreeper and Clay was wrestling a pig. Omi and Raimondo were pretending to play Steal the Wu. Dojo lounged lazily in the sun, feasting on barbecue and hot sauce. What could break this peaceful moment of idling? You\"ll see... Master Fung stepped into grounds, where the monks were hanging out, followed by a 12-year-old girl. \"Young monks,\" he called out, catching the monks\" attention at once, \"We have a new warrior among us.\" The monks immediately gave the girl rapt attention. She was unusually tall with black hair in a ponytail that streamed down her back. She had hard, black eyes and something about her face that said \"Don\"t mess with me\". Her frame was wide hips, a muscular back and broad shoulders. In short, she scared Dojo. Well, he got scared easily anyway, so whatever. When she spoke, she had an unusually quiet voice. \"Hey.\" She was American. \"Ooohhhhhhhhhh. Did mine ears play games with me? A new warrior?!\" Omi gasped. \"It\"s true,\" the girl said, \"I hail from Flushing and I\"ve been training myself in street-fighting and climbing since I started to jump too much. I went learning Kung Fu and Jujitsu when I was ten. Master Fung invited me here telling me that I\"m supposed to become a Shoku warrior with four other warriors and use the element of thunder. My name\"s Drew Werd. You\"re the monks aren\"t you?\" \"Yeah,\" Raimondo stated \"By the way, are you really good enough to be a Shoku warrior so soon?\" Drew glanced at Master Fung uncertainly. Master Fung gave a small nod. \"SHOKU WOLF, THUNDER!\" Drew yelled as she jumped in the air. Blue lightning crackled and swirled in the air and landed in her palms. Her shadow became blue as well and crept all over her. In short, Drew looked like a lightning spirit. Drew looked at some boulders and trees nearby. Focusing, she made a dive for them and swiped. There was a slight flash as the boulders were reduced to a heap of dark ash. Drew landed neatly in front of the monks and looked at Raimondo. \"O.o\" (Crickets chirping) 5 minutes later... \"We\"ve got a new Shen Gong Wu!!!!!!!!!\" Dojo yelled as he slithered into the Wu chamber, where Master Fung was presenting Drew\"s signature Wu, the Eye of Dashi, to her. \"What\"s the Wu?\" Kimiko asked as she fingered the Star of Hanabi lovingly. The monks rushed off to the grounds as Master Fung bid them farewell. Dojo grew to his 40-foot form and the monks jumped on. Drew lodged herself between Kimiko and Omi. Kimiko took her comb out and Dojo started flying. \"Well,\" Dojo began, taking the Wu scroll from his pocket, \"It says here that the River Kunai is supposed to be able to travel long distances as a throwing knife. It can also be used to cling onto when you\"re underwater. It\"ll go forward in any direction you want and you\"ll be able to breathe as long as you hold onto it or someone or something that\"s already holding it.\" \"Pretty cool.\" Raimondo said in awe. \"Oooooohhhhh. It will be moooooooost useful and fun to travel without having to swim!\" Omi squealed. \"So where is it?\" Clay asked as he straightened his hat. \"Tokyo, in the country.\" Dojo answered breezily. \"Home sweet ho-\" Kimiko broke off as she stared at one of the birds flying alongside them. She suddenly felt uneasy. \"Huh?\" Omi and Drew looked at her. \"Eeeerrrrrrr......\" Kimko started to sweat. \"Evil boy genius! Prince of darkness! At your service!\" a voice bragged as a freaky Goth kid came by. He was surrounded by his robots. He was flying alongside Dojo by means of a couple of propellers. \"Jack Spicer! Prepare for a mooooost humiliating defeat!\" Omi yelled. It would be easier to get rid of him right now than have a showdown with him for the Wu later. The monks jumped up, prepared for battle. Kimiko was actually glad to see him. \"JACKBOTS! ATTACK!\" Jack gave the usual command. \"Warriors! Get in formation!\" Omi yelled. \"SHOKU DRAGON FORMATION!!!\" the monks yelled. The monks immediately had their shadows creep up upon them like armor. Jack Spicer\"s jaw dropped. \"HUH!??!?!?!?!\" \"SHOKU WHALE, WATER!\" \"SHOKU LION, FIRE!\" \"SHOKU WOLF, THUNDER!\" \"SHOKU BUZZARD, WIND!\" \"SHOKU BULL, EARTH!\" Omi\"s hands were already swirling with fierce water as he summoned a tsunami out of nowhere. He went for some robots and Jack. Kimiko\"s arms weren\"t even visible under all the swirling flames. She charged, throwing fireballs and blowing fire out of her mouth. Drew was using lightning in her palms again, swiping them like swords. Raimondo brought up a hurricane and charged, blowing wind out of his mouth. Clay used his hands to bring up boulders from the ground so far below. His arms turned to massive stone limbs as he smashed a robot. \"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!\" Spicer was already screaming as Omi pummeled him with water. His propellers broke. Kimiko was just swiping for him when he brought up an extra pair. \"DAMN YOU! MY AUNTIE GAVE ME THOSE FOR VALENTINE\"S DAY!!\" Drew stopped swiping at a crowd of bots to look down at the fleeing freak in surprise. There were people wimpy as that? \"Never mind that Drew!\" Clay yelled, smashing the bots with some boulders. \"I agree!\" Raimondo yelled as he blew the last of the bots away. \"Other evil might want the Shen Gong Wu!\" Kimiko punched the last of the bots as she thought of Hannibal Roy Bean. As the monks scrambled back on Dojo, Kimiko looked over her shoulder again. In the midst of the others chatting over their victory, she couldn\"t help but think that they were being watched... \"The monks have grown well.\" Chase Young commented in his lair. He was watching the monks through a crystal ball. Wuya was, thankfully, in his 5-star bathroom. He didn\"t want her to see this. She was annoying enough as it is. He turned, a slight, familiar smirk crossing his face. It is time...for the seeds of evil grip to the chosen monk...for prophecy to take hold... PT: Alright! Please review! I\"ve got to go now; my dog\"s hopping mad for the bathroom. Is Chase Young behind the evil going on in a monk\"s head? Mmmmmmmmmmaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyyybbbbbbbbbbbbbbeeeeeeee... Again, sorry the stupid fight scene. I\"m bad those. Again, suggestions are welcome! PT: Chappy 4! Yay! Anyway, to Aria Pedrosa, I\"d like to say that I\"m 12 too, in 7th grade. I\"m technically 13, according to my nationality. I guess I don\"t have to worry that much though. My birthday is coming up in August. It brings a lot of stuff. In 2009, I\"ll have to move to a different town. It\"s close to the town I live in now, but I\"m still sad! I\"ve lived in this town for my whole life! I feel jealous of people who have lived in the towns they loved their whole lives and never even plan to move away. I\"ll lose my braces too. The freedom is something I itch for. I\"d like to thank everyone for reviews! Anyway, I hope you enjoy this chapter! \"There it is!\" Raimundo called out, gesturing at field. Dojo had finally taken the monks to the country to Tokyo. He had taken them to a field of cherry blossom trees, or a haruno of sakura, as Kimiko called it. Raimundo gestured again as the other monks whipped their heads around. \"Huh?\" Omi, our cuddly cheeseball, was clearly confused. (Crickets chirping) \"You sure you spotted our Wart?\" Omi and Kimiko turned to look at Clay, who had his mouth open. \"Clay,\" Raimundo said, not turning around, \"You sound like your sister.\" \"That wasn\"t me!\" Clay sputtered, his blond hair lifting so you could see both of his eyes. \"Then who-\" \"It was us!\" a shrill, happy voice cried out. The voice was familiar, veeeeeerrrrrrrrrry familiar... \"Jessie! Megan!\" Omi exclaimed, wide eyed as he gawked at the girls. \"Yo!\" Raimundo waved as he finally turned around, obviously pleased at the sight of the two girls. Drew raised an eyebrow. \"Old friends?\" she inquired of Dojo. \"Yup.\" Dojo replied. \"Well, who\"s this?\" Jessie asked cheerfully, gesturing towards Drew. \"That\"s Drew, for thunder.\" Clay passed out the info breezily, obviously pleased to see his sister without having to tie each other up and attempt to toss each other of a bridge. \"New warrior, huh?\" Jessie asked, looking Drew up and down. \"Uh.\" Drew was obviously freaked out. \"Hi!\" Megan said cheerfully, waving, \"I met this girl with a Shen Gong Wu while I was on vacation here! We both talked a little when I pointed the Wu out and she brought me here, saying she had a tracking device for activated Shen Gong Wu that she stole from my stupid cousin, Jack! So we both figured you knew both of us so I went with Jessie!\" Jessie and Megan were both on Jessie\"s motorcycle, with the Wings of Tanabi attached to the back. \"Hello! Wu anybody?\" a voice called out. \"Huh?\" The monks, Dojo, Jessie and Megan spun around. There, in the sunlight, was a tall, barefoot witch with long, red hair and creepy eye-makeup.Omi was already screaming. \"WUYARETURNTHESHENGONGWUORSUFFERAMOOOOOOOOOOOOOSSTHUMILIATINGDEFEAT!\" (Crickets chirping) \"Ooookaaaaaaaayyyy...\" Kimiko muttered. There was an uncomfortable silence as everyone followed Omi\"s gaze to the object in Wuya\"s hand. It was a silvery-blue kunai knife. \"Oh no you ain\"t!\" Jessie yelled as she tossed her lasso. The loop immediately closed around the kunai. Unfortunately, Clay had let his own trusty lasso out as well. His loop bumped off of Jessie\"s on contact and instead of getting the kunai, he got...Wuya\"s wrist. Wuya grinned evilly and quickly took control of the situation. She gave a flick of her wrists...and sent the blond siblings tumbling toward a large boulder on the ground, to their deaths. \"AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!\" Jessie found herself being jerked out of the motorcycle as the end of the lasso in her hand slipped out of her grasp. She fell, screaming and feeling fluttery in the stomach. Clay screamed even louder as he was pulled off Dojo. He clutched his lasso...finding it to be cut in the middle. The air pressure was too much... \"NNNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!\" Kimiko screamed as she launched herself off Dojo, heading for her friends. \"Shoku lion, fire!\" As she summoned fire, she felt something grabbing her wrist. \"No!\" The fire died down as Wuya tightened her grasp on Kimiko\"s wrist. Raimundo was already in the air, eyes trained on the Japanese warrior... ...As Wuya grabbed him too. \"Well, I\"ve done a nice job today.\" Wuya commented sickeningly, as Omi screamed and went after Clay, Megan right behind him, eyes on Jessie. Drew went for Wuya, eyes determined. Wuya grinned as she tightened her grasp on the struggling Raimundo and Kimiko. \"A Shen Gong Wu...\" Omi and Megan caught the Texan siblings right before they hit the boulder... \"...and two hostages...\" With that, she disappeared just as Drew released a punch...into thin air. \"No!\" Omi screamed. Clay had seen the whole thing. As soon as he got back on Dojo, he took the Fist of Tebigong from his pocket and punched himself. Jessie and Megan just sniffed as Jessie settled down in her motorcycle. Dojo started sobbing...no...bawling. As for Drew, the kid just tipped back her head and howled... All around the world, people suddenly felt jabs in their hearts for no reason at all. Soon, there wasn\"t a dry eye in the heavens or hell. PT: Hope this fight scene was okay. Thanks for all the reviews! I\"ve got a new stream of ideas coming so...yeah... Anyway, no problem. I won\"t make Drew a Mary Sue. Never intended to but I could have made her one accidentally.) Anyway, thanks for reading and reviewing! PT: Hi everybody! ;) I hope you like this chapter! I am hoping to be able to start a pairing in this chapter. You may already know what the pairing is...or not... Anyways, enjoy and please review! Kimiko crawled over to Raimundo. Wuya had taken them to a giant birdcage about as tall as Jack Spicer\"s house, with a diameter of 10 feet. She had left them with their hands tied behind their backs before she left, sniggering. Kimiko and Raimundo could see outside the cage, but there wasn\"t much to see. They were in a grassy field. All they could see was grass, in every direction. Kimiko doubted that they could get away easily. Wuya would definitely be watching and in this field, it won\"t be hard to catch the monks. The only thing they could do was untie themselves. Kimiko nudged Raimundo. \"Wake up!\" she whispered fiercely. She wasn\"t going to sound desperate in front of him. It might give away how worried she was about him. The Brazilian teen opened his eyes. They stared at Kimiko a moment before closing them again. \"Don\"t.\" he moaned wearily. \"Raimundo!\" Raimundo\"s eyes snapped open. His olive green eyes stared at the Japanese warrior. Huh. Now that I think of it, I never really told her how nice her eyes are. I\"ve never seen a more brilliant blue color. \"Raimundo!\" Kimiko snapped, \"Stay awake and help me think of how to escape!\" She\"s cute when she\"s angry. \"How do we get out of here?\" Raimundo asked, deciding to go along. It\"s not like he could go to sleep again. Kimiko would keep prodding him and even resort to beating him up if he won\"t heed her. Raimundo cringed at the thought. Well, if she does, we\"ll be touching each other at the very least. He shook his head. Huh? He had really just thought that? He was so distracted by his thoughts that he didn\"t notice when Kimiko slapped him. \"Earth to Raimudo!\" \"Whuh?\" Kimiko glared at the Xiaolin leader. \"You are our leader! We need to escape to help the others! Who knows what\"ll happen to the other monks if we aren\"t there? Master Fung always taught us about teamwork!\" Raimundo nodded, a numb feeling in his chest. \"Right.\" Teamwork. It seemed to Raimundo that that was what stood in the way of having a relationship with Kimiko. He always cared for his friends. It felt wrong to have feelings for one of them. That would mean he favored one. Raimundo stood up, the numb feeling still in his chest. \"What do you have in mind?\" he asked. Kimiko stared at him for a long time. The only sound was the wind blowing through the grass. Finally, Raimundo broke the silence. \"You were the one worried about escaping!\" he accused, \"Answer me!\" That seemed to do the trick. Kimiko snapped out of whatever had kept her silent and staring. \"Oh! Right.\" She seemed embarrassed. Hey, did she just turn red? \"Alright, here\"s the plan. It\"s what I can think of at the moment. You probably won\"t like it, but here\"s a plan I\"ll suggest for now.\" Kimiko leaned forward. \"You\"ll never believe this, but...\" PT: Yeah, hope this was good. It\"s short, but I\"m slightly busy now. My mom\"s making me decide when to go to Paris. Yay! Paris! Anyway, that nagging is kind of annoying and I hate my mom. Sorry, did I say mom? I mean disowned mom. Forget it. As soon as I turn 18, I\"m not having her in my life again. I wish I could actually disown now. For now, I\"m not speaking to her. Anyway, I need to double check my homework. I\"m in a bit of a cranky mood now. I\"m sorry! ;( Dear everyone, There\"s not much time. I can\"t go on the internet anymore. If I come back, I\"ll private message to you if you want. Tell me in a review. My mom\"s so annoying! Till then, PT PT: OMG, I have no excuse myself for avoiding this fic for sooooo long :( On a brighter side, I\"m updating this again but it\"s going to be kind of slow. Good news though: I\"m almost done with my Naruto Christmas fic, so as soon as I finish that, I can update quickly again! :) Anyway, yeah, I do have problems with my mom. I\"ve hit that age. Anyway, here we go! Note: Drew is not a Mary Sue, but she will be very significant. She will have many Mary Sue properties, but only for future comic relief. Please bear with me, people!"]}

Owl gave Pooh a weird look and he thought, \"EH WHAT DID YOU SAY NOW POOH, TO YOU, YOU THINK NOBODY ELSE CARES ABOUT CHRISTOPHER ROBIN.\" Rabbit then got up slightly and thought, \"WHY POOH BEAR. I NEVER KNEW YOU WERE SO SELFISH.\" \"Poor guy,\" Tigger whispered to Eyeore. \"His very little brain is GAY with grease.\" Pooh then apologized to Owl saying, \"NOO, TO HERE, AND US!\" Owl then exclaimed, \"THEN ITS A QUEST IS IT-\" \"NOOO,\" yelled Rabbit who then jumped onto owls podium, \"WHO AUTHORIZED IT.\" Owl was a little confused but he felt like insulting rabbit so he replied, \"I\"M going to AUTHORIZE it. Taha, ohhhhh, A LONG AND DANGEROUS JOURNEY.\" He said while searching through his house for a piece of parchment. \"THROUGH THE MUSHROOM KINGDOM.\" He continued. \"Ahh of course you\"ll need honey, honey, honey, honey, honey, honey, honey, honey, honey, and a MAP.\" He then started drawing a map from his piece of Parchment. piglet then climbed up because he wanted to know if there were any dangerous creatures on this journey. \"HEFFALUMPS,\" he asked. Owl was cleaning his quill but the movement of his hands caused ink to hit a piglet and he kept whimpering \"UMPS, UMPS, UMPS, UMPS, UMPS, UMPS, UMPS, UMPS, UMPS, UMPS, UMPS, UMPS.\" Owl then replied HEEEEFFFFFAAAAALLLLLUUUUMMMPS, HEFALUMPS.\" He then proceeded to poke Piglet with his quill and each jab caused him to flinch. He then tried to show Piglet where the heffalumps were but he was acting like he was on crack and he kept saying\"Down here I Fancy, You see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, in the the uhhhh.\" He was really going crazy at this point and he was trying to hoot like an owl saying, \"WOO, WOO, WOO, WOO, WOO, WOO, WOO, WOO, WOO, WOO, WOO, WOO,\" \"JAGGGGGGUUUUULLLLAAARRRRSSSSSS.\" asked Pooh. \"NOT TO MENTION THE FABLED SKULLASAURUS.\" Said Owl with suspense. \"SKULLASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS,\" muttered Tigger who was trying to control himself. \"OH COME COME COME, OH COME COME COME, OH COME COME COME,\" said Owl. \"SKULLASAURUS ATTACKS WITH FIRST AID SHIT.\" \"PERHAPS YOU COULD JOIN US,\" asked Pooh. \"NO FUCK YOU GO AHEAD,\" Replied Owl who pulled a lever that opened the trapdoor that Pooh and his friends were standing on. They then ran out of Owls house and scurried to the woods. Their insane adventure has just begun. End of Part 1 HAHA, THIS FIRAT PART IS OVER. Tell me what you think. I\"m trying to follow the YTP as best as I can buy I\"m going to add my own elements to it. Please review and I hope you enjoy the story. And so Pooh and his friends crossed over into well a part of the hundred acre wood which Owl called THE MUSHROOM KINGDOM. WHO KNEW HOW MUCH WORSE. \"Look,\" cried out Pooh. He was staring at a rock with a guys ass on the front. \"GUTSMANS ASS the map read. \"If you\"ve made it this far,\" Rabbit continued, \"You will die.\" All the sudden there was light growling coming from deep within the woods which made everybody turn around and it nearly caused Piglet to faint. He tried to stay calm while asking, \"What was that?\" \"Sounded to hungry for the heffalump,\" answered Tigger. There was more growling from the woods and they all then came close together out of fear. \"Too plump for the jagular.\" he continued. \"Too gay for Gay Luigi,\" he then thought curiously. \"I say its a big old, bogey eyed, saber toothy, Tajomaru bomb.\" They all then waited for something to happen, but nothing did. This caused Tajomaru himself to wonder, \"How did they figure it out?\" \"Skullasaurus,' said Tigger realizing that that may be what is making the noise. \"SKULLASAURUS,' Screamed everybody. At this the Tajomaru bomb exploded and it destroyed the woods. \"Which way do we run,\" asked a frightened Tigger. \"WHERE DO WE HIDE,\" exclaimed Piglet. \"I believe that uhh, uhh that way is a good way,\" answered Pooh who was studying the map. \"This way could be better better,\" he then replied after reconsidering his response. But then he experienced a predicament because he had no idea where to go but he felt pressured to give advice. \"Uhh that way is a good way, this way could be better, over here, there. UHH THAT WAY, THIS WAY COULD BE BETTER, OVER HERE, THERE. UHH THAT WAY, THIS WAY COULD BE BETTER, OVER HERE, THERE. Everybody was running in circles and flashing lights appeared and it caused everybody to nearly go insane. Finally, Rabbit understood what was going on and he yelled, \"SHUT THE F*** UP!\" Everybody stopped and the sky went back to normal. \"Were-getting-nowhere-fast-Pooh-ehh-That-just won\"t do. A leader met be someone leaderly, leaderly, leaderly, leaderly, leaderly, leaderly, someone like,\" he then thought for a second before answering, \"Tajomaru.\" He then thought what Tajomaru would say, he would start laughing and say, \"Tajomaru navigate you guys, NEVER.\" A guy like him lead Pooh and friends? He then thought again, before he replied, \"ME.\" Just then there was a massive farting noise and Rabbit stared at the map, \"Well,\" he said before looking again, \"Well, there, there, there, there there, there, there, there, as you can see we can lose him if we cut across this lovely meadow.\" They then walked into a very \"Lovely\" meadow filled with thorns, lethal plants and evil crows. \"And a lovely meadow it is commented Rabbit who almost hit a large thorn. He then saw a plant and he said, \"Why look, is that a golden daphidillas, RARE FOR THIS LOCATION.\" Chomp and the plant bit off Rabbits head and killed him... PSYCHE \"What exactly is this location Rabbit,\" asked Pooh. \"Where else would we be,\" answered Rabbit nervously. He then heard a mysterious voice saying \"DINNER, DINNER, DINNER, DINNER, DINNER, DINNER, DINNER.\" He then asked himself, \"OWL HOWWWWW ARE WE.\" He then concluded that he was correct in going through this weird maze and he just had to justify it. \"PRECISELY WHY I CHOSE IT, NOOOOOO, SKULLSAURUS WOULD DARE FOLLOW US IN HERE. HEHEHEHE.\" A SKULLSAURUS can\"t. But Roy Batty can. Suddenly Rabbits ears went berserk and they became petrified with fear and they pointed sideways. Finally Piglet lost it and he started running off on his own and Pooh tried going after him. \"PIGLET COME BACK COME BACK.\" He yelled. \"Then Roy Batty ran after Piglet and mimicked Poohs voice to try to trick Piglet, \"PIGLET COME BACK.\" Piglet just kept on running and he couldn\"t control his fear. Roy Batty continued chasing him laughing like a maniac. Piglet didn\"t know where he was going only that he had to get out. He finally escaped Roy Batty and he ended up safe for the moment. After his unsuccessful chase with Piglet, he yelled, \"FUCK.\" before realizing that he could use his secret weapon, this new knowledge caused him to laugh evilly. Piglet was starting to feel at peace when he saw a weird face that looked awfully like John Cleese making a face like a butterfly. It put Piglet in a trance and it made Piglet go running up to it. He then approached a bush full of butterfly\"s when the face appeared. It then disappeared when Piglet started sniffing the butterfly\"s and when one landed on his face the John Cleese face appeared again. Just then Pooh appeared and he cried out, \"MY MY I BELIEVE YOU HAVE MADE A FRIEND. PIGLET.\" The face then gave a gazed at Pooh and Poohs eyes bulged out and put Pooh in a trance. Meanwhile Rabbit was reading the map and he read, \"THESE ARE THE FACES OF EVIL. Uh hmm.\" Just then a giant face attacked Rabbit and nearly crushed him. \"MY FACES OF EVIL.\" Exclaimed Roy Batty. \"FIGHT THEM.\" A swarm of butterfly\"s swarmed around Piglet and they began pulling him up. Pooh and friends didn\"t understand what they had to do and they all thought that the butterfly\"s were nice unaware that they were forms of the faces of evil. Pooh was actually smiling when the butterfly\"s were lifting Piglet into the air. Pooh then realized that Piglet was calling for help and that he was going higher and higher into the air. Tigger and Pooh tried to call out to him but the butterflies disguised as the faces of evil had no intention of losing Piglet and were intent on taking him to Roy Batty. \"PERHAPS YOU COULD ASK YOUR FRIENDS TO BRING YOU BACK.\" Yelled Pooh. Finally the faces of evil came back and they appeared. It became clear to Pooh and friends that Piglet was being kidnapped. Eventually Pooh rescued Piglet from the faces of evil. I MAY ADD MY OWN VERSION OF HOW POOH RESCUES PIGLET IF YOU WANT TO READ IT LET ME KNOW, DURING THAT TIME RABBIT WWENT TO A BAR WHERE HE HAD ONE DRINK TOO MANY. \"Uhhhh, THIS WAY.\" Rabbit said still feeling the effects of the alcohol. Tigger and the others followed but Pooh wanted to make sure Piglet was okay. \"Are you all right Piglet.\" Asked Pooh who was very concerned. \"No,\" replied Piglet. \"Uhh, but saving me was uhh, very brave of you.\" A face of evil landed behind Piglet and nearly put Pooh in another trance. But Pooh snapped out of it and he took the face of evil which turned into a butterfly off Piglet and placed it on a flower. \"But your brave, braver than,\" began Pooh but he couldn\"t think of something Piglet was braver than. Piglet got a little exacted and wanted to know what he was braver than but Pooh replied, \"IF ONLYY I COUUULLD REEEEMMMMMEEEMMBBBBEEEEERRRRRRRRR.\" The face of evil watched Pooh and Piglet as they disappeared. Realizing this plan failed utterly Roy Batty yelled, \"FUCK, IM GONNA HAVE TO KILL POOH AND HIS FRIENDS.\" OH NO! End of Part 2 This-way-and-that-way-the-map-took-them-to-all-the-places-where-Christopher-Robin-wasn\"t,-but-to-none-of-the-places- he-was. And still Rabbit refused to realize the map was a fuck-ing piece of shit. Tigger and Rabbit were going to the edge of a cliff and Rabbit began to reveal his master plan while Tigger mimicked his every move. \"So-we\"ll-first-move-east-by-south-then-south-by-east. Of-course-minus-the-variation-plus-thhe-wind-drift-we-clearly-go,uhhhhhh, this west west west west west west west west west way. During this time the map kept closing on Tiggers nose. Rabbit noticed and the pulled the map off Tiggers face only to kept smashing it back into his face to teach him to control his impulses. Pooh was staring at the mountains when he asked, \"I wonder if those rather forbidden looking mountains might be the forbidden mountains. Where Christopher Robin is.\" \"No,\" replied Rabbit coldly. \"The way to there is over here.\" Rabbit smirked. Pooh felt awfully confused by Rabbits stupidity. \"But Rabbit,\" began Pooh. \"Isn\"t that them, over there.\" Rabbit couldn\"t accept he was wrong and his arrogance caused him to believe Pooh was the stupid one. \"Now which are you going to believe, this \"Official\" map, or your own eyes.\" \"God, I know what your thinking, Rabbit\"s a friggen idiot,\" said Tajomaru who was watching in the background. \"And I am starting a Rebellion against him.\" \"Really said Zelda who was listening while taking out a knife. \"Oh boy I can\"t wait to go and kill Rabbit.\" Said Link who was all excited. \"Be off,\" said the King who allowed Link to join, but Zelda had to stay behind. Oh yeah. Rabbit\"s a bit hyper. Lights started flashing quite suddenly and Rabbit was dancing around like a lunatic seemingly worshiping the map. He had no idea that Roy Batty was trying to get Rabbit to kill himself in his insanity. He tried to get everybody to worship the map the way he did, but nobody was gonna be as stupid as Rabbit. During his dance, he accidentally got the map caught in a tree and it tore in two wnding the light flashing. When Rabbit noticed he sceamed in terror. \"AHHHH, OH NO! THE MAP, GET THE MAP! WITH ONLY HALF A MAP WERE LESS THAN NOWHERE.\" \"After that map,\" yelled Tigger and he tried to launch himself after the map but his tail got stuck in a rock and he couldn\"t get free until after a few moments of puling. The struggle hurt his tail but Tigger didn\"t notice as he chased the map to a log. HE then bounced up and down over the log for some time. \"I got it, don\"t have it,\" he called out. \"I got it, don\"t have it, I got it, don\"t have it, I got it, don\"t have it.\" \"I have it, I don\"t have it now, I have it, I don\"t have it now. I have it, I don\"t have it now, I have it, I don\"t have it now. Now, now, now, now, now, now.\" He continued bouncing unaware that it was a huge drop to the bottom of the massive gorge he was bouncing over. \"Ill get it, No i don\"t, I have it.\" Tigger continued while bouncing over log. When he landed this time the log cracked slightly. \"Hmmm,\" he thought. \"I wonder whats causing this tail to fail. I wonder whats causing this tail to fail. I wonder whats causing this fail to tail.\" He then realized his mistake and he concluded that, \"It\"s been one of those days.\" Meanwhile Roy Batty gave a wolf howl in the background and it caused the log to crack again and Tigger looked down. \"SHIT,\" he yelled. The log then broke in two and Tigger began to fall but his tail was hitting the falling log so he was bale to keep himself up for a while before falling completely. \"CHHHHHRRRIIIIISSSSSTTTTOOOOPPPPHHHHHEEEEEERRRRRR RRRRRROOOOOOOOOOBBBBBIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINNNN.\" The log then got jammed in the rocks and Tigger landed on it. But Tigger\"s bouncy body caused him to bounce up and down while trying to catch the log. For once Tigger wished that he wasn\"t a Tigger. Finally after 7 terrifying seconds Tigger stabilized and he was able to hold onto the log. Pooh was staring at Tigger below and he wanted to talk to Tigger so he called his name over and over so he could get Tigger\"s attention. He then said, \"You could fall.\" \"Yeah,-well-you-know-what-they-say-what-doesn\"t-bounce-up-has-uh-gottta-fall-down.\" he then accidentally laughed like Roy Batty and that almost caused the tree trunk to collapse. \"There\"s-no-time-for-this-we-have-too-many-delays-so-you-just-bounce-out-of-there-this-moment,\" said Rabbit who wanted to turn the attention to finding the map. Tigger laughed, but then said, \"No way.\" \"Bounce out of there this moment,\" called Rabbit. \"No way,\" Tigger replied. \"Bounce,\" said Rabbit. \"No,\" replied Tigger. \"Bounce.\" \"No.\" \"Bounce.\" \"No.\" \"Bounce.\" \"NOOOOO.\" \"There\"s no time for this we\"ve had too many delays,\" yelled Rabbit who was starting to get angry, \"So you just bounce, out of-\" \"NO WAY.\" \"BOUNCE,\" Rabbit ordered, but he lost control of his anger and he started screaming at Tigger, \"YOU MISERABLE PIECE OF DICK BRAINED HORSESHIT, SLIME SUCKING SON OF A WHORE, BITCH!\" That did it, Tigger started crying ad he had to explain why he wouldn\"t bounce. \"Okay, Okay, you got me. The truth is.\" H whimpered, \"It\"s been one of those days.\" He then felt ashamed and he wished he was a good bouncer. \"Oh, well don\"t worry Tigger,\" said Pooh, \"Christopher Robin said, I just have to remember, your. Uhhhhhh. Taller than the Egyptian.\" Tigger felt confused and wondered why Poo would say something like that, \"Slower than Bowser. Do you feel any bouncier now.\" He finished. \"Nope,\" replied Tigger gloomily. \"Bounce up this far,\" Pooh encouraged, but he fell and Piglet caught his foot at the last second. \"How about now?\" Pooh asked. \"NO NO NO NO,\" replied Tigger, \"NO NO NO NO, NO NO NO NO, NO NO NO NO.\" Piglet then fell with Pooh and Rabbit dove down to save him. Eyeore meanwhile was watching the map fly overhead and he reached out to grab it because he thought it was food but Rabbit pulled him down too. Eyeore chomped on the root and he held on with all his strength. \"Tigger was crying but Pooh was lowered enough where he could tap his head. Tigger looked up and said, \"Okay.\" Just as Tigger grabbed Pooh the log fell to the ground. Eyeore was grunting from holding onto the root with his teeth. He then let go of the branch to say, \"IIIIII SSSSAAAAAIIIIIDDDDD OOOOUUUUUUCCCCHHH.\" By the time he realized his mistake, it was too late and they all fell down the huge gorge, while Roy Batty was laughing in the background. \"Go to hell,\" he commanded as they crashed into the depths of the abyss. It seemed that nobody had survived and there was no signs of life other than a few plants. \"Yes,\" Roy Batty said. He looked again to make sure nobody was alive. \"YES,\" he said happily, \"YES.\" He then thought \"Victory at last.\" Suddenly Pigelt emerged and he rubbed the mud out of his eyes. \"WHAT THE FUCK.\" yelled Roy Batty, \"Piglet survived.\" Suddenly Pooh emerged too, and he reassured Piglet who thought he was a monster. \"Now don\"t worry Piglet.\" \"Shit,\" said Roy Batty who was watching overhead. \"Pooh survived too.\" \"It\"s only me,\"Pooh continued. \"Ohh, said piglet who felt much better after seeing it was his friend. Three more shapes however came out of the mud and Pooh had to explain, \"Now don\"t worry Piglet, it\"s only Tigger, and Rabbit, and Eyeore.\" \"Roy Batty then frowned angrily, \"Dammit,\" he thought, \"None of them are dead.\" \"The map,\" yelled Rabbit, \"We have it, haha, we can go now.\" \"My plan did absolutely nothing what so ever.\" Roy Batty screamed. He then lost it and he went crazy before deciding to launch an immediate second attack. He then boomed over the skY, \"HAVE A FREE SAMPLE OF MY SUPER FREEZE BREAD.\" A flying object zoomed overhead, and Pooh yelled, \"RUN AWAY, RUN AWAY, RUN AWAY, RUN AWAY, RUN AWAY, RUN AWAY, RUN AWAY.\" Just then Tajomaru\"s rebellion arrived only to be crushed by the Super Freeze Bread, as Pooh and friends ran off in the distance. Just then a giant thought it was a good time to start humping the air in all the chaos. And so Pooh and friends continued only to be blocked by a deep fog, what ridiculous shit could possibly go on, let\"s find out. Rabbit emerges first and he is trying to read the broken map but he does doesn\"t seem to have any idea where he is. The others appeared behind and Pooh asked, \"Won\"t you know which way that sucking, licking uncle pa, Christopher Robin is?\" Rabbit thought carefully, before replying \"Uh, umm, well, I think, ahh-\" but then it occurred to him that he was lost and he tried to conceal it but he feared that he was already looking like a moron. \"There\"s this way of course,\" he said encouragingly. However he was stopped by a mysterious character who yelled, \"IMMA FIRIN MY LAZER.\" A giant beam attacked Rabbit and it convinced him to look in a different direction. \"But, that\"s the right way,\" he said confused before saying, \"We obviously want to go this way,\" he said with beefing confidence. Only this time he ran into another figure who called, \"GARBAGE DAY.\" \"Huh,\" asked Rabbit until the figure pulled out a gun, \"NO,\" he cried. He escaped just in time before getting killed, \"Sorry.\" He was now getting upset, \"Oh well, we can\"t rule out this way.\" He then ran off in this new direction... Only to run into, The Joker. \"Why so serious son, let\"s put a smile on that face,\" he asked. The joker burst out laughing and he scared Rabbit enough to have him run back to the others like a coward. Trying to be optimistic, \"Theres this way of course. We obviously want to go this way. Although we cant rule out this way.\" He realized that he was not helping so he thought about what he should do but he was getting nervous and finally he started panicking, \"This way, this way, this way. This way, this way, this way. This way, this way, this way. This way, this way, th-\" Wolverine who was watching in the background, screamed out in rage before finally exploding. Rabbit trying to hold himself together smiled at the others. A halo popped other his head. He then realized that the others were frowning angrily. One month later. Rabbit concluded that he was in deep trouble, \"Now if Christopher Robin was here what would he say, well, he\"d say.\" Rabbit then thought about it before realizing in horror that Christopher would yell, \"This is Sparta.\" Before kicking him into a giant pit. He ended up saying those words dramatically to everybody, \"AND ITS RABBITS FAULT.\" He added. Trying to justify his errors he screamed \"THIS SHIT, ISNT EVEN ON THE MAP, THE MAP, THE MAP, THE MAP, THE MAP, THE MAP.\" \"The Map,\" Tigger said as if to say, \"We get it.\" \"Ahha,\" Rabbit wailed, \"That Rabbit is just gay enough to not know where to go, or hmf hmf what to do. Uhhaa.\" Suddenly everybody looked at Rabbit with pity. Even he didn\"t deserve this. He was trying his best to help. Finally Pooh broke the silence by trying to be nice to rabbit. \"Oh, Christopher Robin said, at a time like this, all I need to do is remember.\" \"Remember what,\" asked Rabbit. Pooh then responded by saying what he heard on T.V. once because he thought it was a good comment, \"Shove it up your ugly ass.\"", "Walker and Alex were in their living room relaxing after they had the children asleep and Alex brought up something in their plans that was bothering her \" Walker, if I understand your\"s and Trivette\"s plan correctly you are going to be posing as a ranch hand. If you do that how are you going to be able to keep an eye on me while I\"m at work? If McKee is going to do something to me, wouldn\"t he be more likely to do it when the opportunity presents itself? I mean he\"s going to be dropping in on Gage while he\"s assigned to the F.B.I. and their branch office isn\"t that far from where I work at. Wouldn\"t that be a perfect time for him to try something instead of him waiting to get me out here?\"\" I doubt that he would try something in front of everyone but since you\"re worried about him doing exactly that you should know that I will be close by in case anything happens. Alex trust me on this. McKee will not hurt you again. And when I do get my hands on him he will pay for what he did to you before.\" Walker assured Alex who nodded okay then said \" I don\"t know about you cowboy but I think it\"s time to turn in.\"Walker protested \" Alex it\"s only nine o\"clock at night. We don\"t need to turn in yet, do we?\" Alex smiled as she started undoing her blouse buttons and after she removed the blouse Alex dropped it on the floor and said \" I know that it\"s only nine o\"clock at night but I wasn\"t planning on going to sleep for a couple more hours yet but I was planning on being in bed with you until then. However if you really don\"t want to go to bed right now I guess that I can always keep the bed warm until you\"re tired. Good night dear.\" Alex then left the living room. Walker just shook his head at her less than subtle attempt to intice him into going to bed early but he also got up and followed his wife to their bedroom.Trivette entered the F.B.I. headquarters in Houston and told the clerk \" Rangers Trivette and Walker reporting in.\" The pair was directed to Special Agent Farley who then gave them a tour of the office, after that he showed them to a desk. Farley then said to them \" We really don\"t know what the two of you are supposed to be doing because no one left instructions on what you two were going to do.\"Trivette answered \" Look all we know is that we were supposed to be assigned to the Dallas Field office for a pilot program and the next thing we know we\"re getting assigned to be here today and a pair of Rangers from Austin get assigned to the Dallas office. If you ask me the F.B.I. has a very strange way of doing things.\" Farley replied \" It doesn\"t make any sense to me either so if you gentlemen will have a seat, I\"l check the computer to see why the assignments were changed at the last minute.\"After a few minutes Farley told them \" You two aren\"t supposed to be here at all, somehow there was a mixup and your names were subsituted for the two Texas Rangers from Austin who were supposed to be assigned here. As a matter of fact they are going to be arriving here in two days so that means the two of you can go back home.\"Gage reported in at nine for his assignment to the F.B.I. and Olstead said to him \" Officer Gage, Holland said that he wanted to meet with you at the D.A.\"s office this morning, you have to be there at ten. Apparently Holland needs some information from you for this assignment.\" Gage said okay and went to the D.A.\"s office where he was directed to have a seat and that someone would be with him shortly. As he was waiting for Holland Gage heard a man ask him \" Officer Gage is that you?\"Gage turned around to see Dwight McKee standing there so he said \" Yes, it\"s me and thanks for making this assignment possible. By the way I stayed out at the Walker\"s ranch for a couple of days and his wife who had just returned from being missing was there and boy let me tell you she looks an a lot like your wife Dani. Are the two of them long lost twins or something?\" McKee said \" As far as I know my wife was an only child but enough about her. I\"m more interested in what you\"ve been up to. Is there a place where we can get some lunch?\" Gage answered \" How about we eat at C.D.\"s? It\"s near here and a lot of Rangers and court personel eat there. Maybe Mrs. Walker will be there too and you\"ll see what I mean about her being your wife\"s long lost twin, or something like that.\" McKee agreed to eat lunch at C.D.\"s.Alex looked around one last time before entering C.D.\"s and was disappointed when he couldn\"t spot her husband anywhere. As she was eating Gage came into the place with McKee. Alex steeled herself and didn\"t react when Gage brought McKee to where she was sitting. Gage said \" Mrs. Walker I\"m sorry to intrude but Agent McKee was struck by me telling him how much you look like his wife Dani and wanted to meet you to see for himself.\"McKee smirked at Alex who said \" Nice to meet you Agent McKee.\" McKee then told her \" You really do look like my Dani. Maybe you can come to my house and replace her. She\"s always running off because of that brain injury she got in a car wreck. Every time I get her back I have to set the ground rules again and let me tell you that\"s getting a little tiring. I\"ll bet you know how to behave yourself. What with being married to a Texas Ranger. I\"ll bet he knows how to lay down the law.\"Alex got up from the table and told them \" I have to get back to court.\" McKee then suggested \" Hey I\"d like to see you in action. Mind if I tag along? I can drive you there. My rental car is right outside. Gage you can get yourself a ride back. Can\"t you?\" Gage replied \" I guess I can but maybe Mrs. Walker doesn\"t want to be bothered while she\"s in court.\"\" Nonsense. A woman like her wants to show what\"s she\"s made of. Isn\"t that so Mrs. Walker?\" McKee said causing Alex to tell him \" I don\"t need to show what I\"m made of and besides I have my minivan outside so I don\"t need a ride but thanks for offering. However if you want to follow me to court who am I to stop you.\" McKee followed her outside to the back of C.D.\"s where Alex\"s minivan was parked. He again attempted to talk her into taking a ride from him but Alex rebuffed him by saying \" Look I think that you have something more in mind that watching me in the courtroom so let me make this clear to you, I am not interested. Now please leave me alone.\"In a heartbeat McKee\"s temperment changed and he grabbed a hold of Alex\"s arm as he snarled at her \" It doesn\"t matter what you do or don\"t want Dani. All that matters is what I want and that\"s you back in my home. And don\"t bother screaming for help because I will punish you for each and every scream that you make, got that?\" \" Listen I don\"t know who you think I am but my name is Alex Cahill-Walker, not Dani. You had better release me now if you know what\"s good for you. Otherwise my husband will deal with you.\" McKee laughed at her then said \" I know that your name is Alex. Hell I knew that when I took you from that hospital. As for that husband of your\"s, he\"s off in Houston and isn\"t going to be any help to you, now is he? Now get moving before I give you a taste of what\"s in store for you when I get you home.\"Alex refused to move so McKee raised his arm to hit her when Gage came over to them and said \" Agent McKee this isn\"t your wife and even if it were your wife there is no way that I\"m going to stand by and let you hit her. Now let her go.\" McKee ordered him \" Officer Gage go back inside of that bar.\" When Gage didn\"t move McKee added \" Your assignment is over with as of this moment. You know former officer Gage you really should of left here while you had a chance.\" McKee drew a gun and pointed it at Gage but it was kicked out of his hand by Walker who said \" I\"ll take care of him you go back inside Alex.\"\" Not on your life. I want him taken care of and I\"m going to stay here and watch to see that he\"s taken care of.\" Walker turned to look at Alex and McKee attacked him. Walker rebuffed him and set about paying McKee back for what he had done to Alex. McKee soon began pleading for Walker to stop hitting him but Walker only stopped hitting McKee when he heard C.D.\"s voice telling him \" That\"s enough son. You don\"t need to be going to jail for killing him. Cordell why don\"t you see Alex to her office?\" Walker released McKee and went to where Alex was standing. Alex asked her husband \" Are you okay?\"Walker nodded that he was okay and they got into Alex\"s minivan and drove off to the courthouse where Alex\"s office was. A short time later as Walker was leaving her office Captain Harland spotted him and questioned \" Ranger Walker can you tell me why you\"re here when you\"re supposed to be in Houston? Also while you\"re doing that can you tell me why Special Agent McKee wants to press assault charges against you? How did he end up such a bloody mess? Did you have anything to do with it?\"\" That\"s a long story Captain Harland.\" Walker answered but Harland told him \" I have all afternoon.\" Walker went back to Ranger headquarters with Harland. When Alex left her office to go to court Gage was there and he told her \" I\"m going to follow you around until you get home Mrs. Walker. I hope that you don\"t mind?\"\" That\"s fine by me Officer Gage and I\"m sure that Walker would like that.\" Alex said to him. Chapter Six After hearing Walker\"s explanation for why he had beaten McKee Harland stared at him in disbelief for a few minutes then asked him \" Walker how did McKee know that your wife was in the hospital with amnesia to begin with? Also what caused A.D.A. Cahill-Walker to lose her memory? And who was buried as her? We have to get the answers to these questions and it needs to be done fairly quickly. Now I don\"t like to pry into the private lives of the Ranger who work out of this office but has your wife ever told you why she ended up in the hospital with amnesia? Does she know who was driving her car when it wrecked into that bridge overpass abuttment?\"Walker answered \" Alex has never told me why she ended up in the hospital with amnesia, nor have I ever asked her. And as far as I know Alex doesn\"t know who was driving her car that day. As for McKee knowing she was there I have no idea but you\"d better believe that I intend to find out the answer.\"Harland then said \" Ranger Walker why don\"t you go talk to your wife while I handle finding out how McKee knew she was in the hospital with amnesia?\" Walker realizing that his Captain was more or less ordering him to question Alex about that time replied \" Captain Harland, Alex may not remember how she ended up in the hospital but if she does she\"ll file a report with this office and the D.A.\"s office.\" Walker then left Harland\"s office and went to Alex\"s office where Gage was waiting outside her door. Gage said to him \" Since you\"re here Walker I\"ll be taking off now.\"Walker went into Alex\"s private office and snuck up on her. When he grabbed her by her waist Alex let out a loud scream and quickly turned around to face him with her fingers ready to scratch his eyes out. Seeing that it was Walker Alex said to him \" What were you thinking? Sneaking up on me like that? I almost clawed your eyes out.\"Walker pulled his wife into a hug as he told her \" Alex relax he can never hurt you again.\" Alex removed herself from Walker\"s arms and moved away from him before saying \" I\"m not so sure about that. That man will be a threat to me until he\"s put behind bars.\"\" About that. Harland wants to know if you remember how you ended up in the hospital with amnesia, do you?\" Walker asked his wife who turned away from him so he went to Alex turned her back around to face him and said \" Alex what\"s wrong? You know that anything you tell me about what happened then won\"t affect the way that I feel about you. So please tell me what\"s bothering you. I know something is really starting to bother you.\"\" You do need to know what I\"ve remembered from that time but I don\"t want to discuss it here. Can we go get the children and go home? After they\"re asleep we can talk about what happened then.\" Alex requested of Walker who led her out of her office.As they were going to the daycare center to get their children Walker and Alex were confronted by Olstead who asked them \" Why did you beat McKee to a pulp Ranger Walker? Was it because your wife wishes that she were still living with him under a assumed name? Instead of with you? And you lady, why did you live with McKee then run off on him when he was just protecting you from your cheating, wife abusing husband Cordell Walker? Don\"t have anything to say, do you? What\"s the matter don\"t you want the truth to come out? Well guess what, it is if I have anything to say about it.\"Walker glared at Olstead while Alex answered in a frosty voice \" The truth will come out because my husband and I will see to it. We will not allow McKee to get away with his lies any longer. I will be filing several charges against McKee. They include but are not limited to assault and battery, terroristic threats, kidnapping, obstruction of justice and also filing false reports with a local police department and the federal goverment. Now please get out of our way.\"Olstead didn\"t move so Walker told him \" Move or I\"ll move you.\" Olstead stepped aside but told them \" This isn\"t over with Ranger Walker. We will be filing charges too and they include but are not limited to interference with the judical system, impersonating a police officer for personal gain and last but not least, assault and battery on a federal agent.\"Later on that evening after the children were asleep Alex said to her husband \" I need to tell you what I\"ve remember but before I start I want your word that you won\"t take the children off of me because of it.\" Walker took her hands and looking Alex in the eyes vowed \" There is nothing that you can do or say that would make me take our children off of you. You have my word.\"Alex answered \" Okay.\" But before she could add anything else the doorbell rang so she told him \" Answer it, we\"ll talk after whoever it is leaves. I need to think about how I\"m going to tell you what I have to tell you anyhow.\" Chapter Seven Walker opened the door to find Trivette and Gage standing there. Trivette said \" C.D. told me what happened earlier and I wanted to stop by and see if Alex is all right. Gage here needs a place to stay. After he tried to help Alex out Olstead removed him from the pilot program.\" Gage added \" I\"m headed back to Houston tomorrow but I need a place to stay tonight.\" Walker let them in and they went into the living room where Trivette asked \" Alex how are you doing?\"\" Okay, I guess. Trivette I was just getting ready to tell Walker about some of the things that I\"ve remembered. I\"d like for you and Officer Gage to hear what I have to say. So will the two of you stay?\"\" Yes we will Alex.\" Trivette answered for the both of them so Alex began \" That morning when I went to the garage to get my car there was a blonde haired woman having a verbal disagreement with a man in the parking lot of the garage. I didn\"t think much of it but I should have. I overheard her telling this man and I quote ' Don\"t go in there, I have a bad feeling about all of this.' The man shrugged off what the woman was saying and went into the garage. I also went into the garage to get my car and heard the first man saying something about being set-up to another man. When I said that I was there for my car they both shut up. I put my purse into the trunk of the car but kept my briefcase with me. As I was trying to leave the parking lot to enter traffic I heard a gun shot so I got out of my car and went back into the garage where the man from the parking lot was laying in a pool of blood. I took my briefcase with me because my cell phone was in it. When I went into the garage a man was standing over the man on the floor and he said something about a rat getting his. I dug my cell phone out of my briefcase to call for help as the man raised his gun at me. A voice behind me told him not to because he had plans for me. This voice behind me told the gunman to go finish off the rat\"s girlfriend, that he would take care of me. I threw my briefcase at the gunman and took off running to try and get into my car but the blond haired woman was speeding away in it. I was then pistol whipped by the gunman so I kicked him as hard as I could. I really tried to get away from them but the man who had been behind me smacked me in the back of the head with something and everything went black. I also have what I think is a memory but I\"m not sure if it is real. The memory may have occured when I\"m trying to come to from being hit on the back of the head. I hear a man say that since Bruce is dead they would be able to move several shipments before the F.B.I. would send someone else in undercover. Walker the reason that I\"m not sure that the memory is real is because it\"s McKee\"s voice that I hear saying that and there\"s a major part of me that wants him to be the person leaking the information. If I were to file a report against him based on what may be a faulty memory it would be laughed at or dismissed because I have a good reason to despise him.\"Gage who had grown pale while Alex was explaining questioned her \" What did Bruce look like? And the blonde haired woman that was with him. What did she look like?\" Alex replied \" From what I can remember Bruce had long stringy brown hair and hazel eyes, he was also skinny and kind of dirty. He also had a scar over his left eye that went up into his hairline. The blonde haired woman who was with him had hair about my length but it was pulled back in a pony tail. Why do you want to know what they looked like Gage?\"\" Because you may have witnessed the murder of my friend Bruce Murphy by the people he was investigating. The blonde haired woman who took off in your car could have been his contact, her name was Jenny Lind. Do you remember the name of the garage?\" Gage said to Alex who told him \" As a matter of fact I do because the name ryhmed, it was Debarge Garage. Was that where your friend was undercover?\"After Gage nodded that it was Trivette asked \" Now what do we do? Alex witnessed a murder but no one is going to believe her when she says that McKee was there and that he\"s involved with drug smuggling.\" Walker said \" I know that Trivette so we\"re going to get the proof on McKee then see to it that he\"s arrested for what he\"s been doing. McKee must have thought he was in the clear when Alex had amnesia but he wanted to be sure so he convinced the hospital that she was his wife. I think that he had planned on getting Alex out of the hospital then getting rid of her before she remembered everything. Once he got her to his house and realized that she didn\"t remember him...well he got other ideas.\"Gage spoke up \" If that\"s the case why would he have ever left her there alone? I mean he had to have known that you would take off at the first chance that you got. After all he had just abused you.\"\" Ego for one plus he was counting on the fact that I was too scared to cross him and let\"s face it a lot of women who have been abused wouldn\"t dare think about taking off because the thought of being beaten again would keep them from seeking help. I have to tell you that there was a very large part of me that was terrified to cross him but there was another part of me that made me leave just as soon as I could. Walker one way or the other we have to get him. And I think we should start by seeing if this Jenny Lind is missing and if so why no one is looking for her. I mean there had to have been someone who would miss her.\" Alex said to them.Trivette agreed \" I think that I can get some of my contacts to find out if she\"s alive and if she isn\"t why no one is looking for her. Also maybe we can have some D.N.A. tests performed on the body to see if it is the body of Jenny Lind. Alex can you have your father take care of that? He was in charge of what we all thought was your body.\" After Alex nodded yes that she would do that Trivette added \" I think that I\"ll call my contacts when I get home, which is where I\"m going now.\" Trivette left and Gage who was still upset told them \" I\"m going to turn in now.\"After Gage went into the guestroom Walker asked \" Alex why did you think that I would take the children off of you for that?\" Alex instead of answering him got up and headed for the steps. When Walker caught up to her she told him \" I didn\"t tell them everything. There\"s something that I think only you should know.\"Walker nodded okay and they went into their bedroom where a nervous Alex blurted out \" I betrayed you when I was at McKee\"s house.\" Walker tried to reassure her by saying \" Alex you didn\"t know who you were or what you were doing. I understand, it\"s okay.\"Alex stared at him for a minute then asked \" It\"s okay that I kissed another man? Are you crazy?\" Walker said \" Alex just tell me what happened. I promise you that no matter what you tell me I won\"t take the children away from you. You have to trust me honey.\"\" I don\"t deserve you Cordell Walker. When we got to McKee\"s house I asked him where was I sleeping at and he told me that I would be sleeping with him like always. He then pulled me to him while saying that we were going to set the night on fire like we always did. So when he kissed me I kissed him back. I am so sorry.\" Alex was explaining when Walker broke in to question her \" Alex are you telling me that you had sex with him?\"\" No. But at first I was willing to sleep with him. When we kissed again it didn\"t seem right to me so I told him that I was sorry but I wasn\"t going to have sex with him. McKee pulled me close again and forcibly kissed me but I shoved him away and told him no. It was then that he beat me for refusing to have sex with him. As he was beating me he told me that I had always been like that, playing hard to get at first. I fell to my knees and pleaded with him not to hit me anymore and he said that he would if I would be a dutiful wife. To stop him from hitting me anymore I agreed. As he was pulling me to my feet the doorbell rang. It was Gage and I asked him to help get me out of there but he didn\"t. After Gage left McKee slapped me around some more and then told me that since he was such a nice guy he would cut me a break. He then dragged me to a bedroom and locked me in it. The next day he told me that he would be leaving on a assignment again and that when he returned I had better be a dutiful wife so I kissed him to make him think I had learned my lesson and told him that I would be well-behaved when he returned, you know the rest. I\"m so sorry Walker.\" Alex said as she began crying. Gathering her into his arms Walker stated \" Alex you have nothing to be sorry for. You did not betray me. What you did was survive until you were able to come back to your family. I love you lady and that\"s never going to change.\"Alex removed herself from Walker\"s arms and told him \" Walker while I was trying to survive when I fled that house I was really trying to find a reason to celebrate the fact that I was alive but it was hard to do that when I was always looking over my shoulder scared to death that he would find me and punish me.\"Walker vowed \" Alex your living in fear is over with and I will give you a reason to celebrate life, got that?\" Alex replied \" Just the fact that you believe in me is cause for me to celebrate but not tonight if you don\"t mind.\"\" Whenever you want to celebrate let me know. I\"ll be there.\" Walker teased Alex who answered \" You\"re always there for me. I love you so much Cordell.\" Chapter Eight The next morning Alex asked her husband \" Walker my briefcase that was with me in San Antonio, where did you put it? I mean it had to have been sent to you with my personal effects, right?\" Walker answered \" No it wasn\"t. Alex you said that the last time you saw it was in the Debarge Garage. After you were knocked out McKee most likely went through it and found out who you were.\"\" I wonder if they threw it away because if they didn\"t maybe we can somehow get a search warrant and hopefully find it there. Although I\"m willing to bet that if it\"s anywhere, it\"s at McKee\"s home. He\"s egotistical enough to hang on to it as a reminder of how smart he thinks that he is. But first things first, we have to prove that it was Jenny Lind buried as me then we have to prove that McKee filed false police reports. I\"ll have a friend of mine who works near San Antonio see if she can get copies of the police reports pertaining to my so-called fatal accident. My father is already working on getting copies of my medical records from when I was in that hospital with amnesia. If Mckee signed the release papers we have him on fraud. Is there anything else that you can think of that we need to do to get McKee?\" Alex said to Walker who pulled her into a kiss then told her \" That\"s what I love about you, you\"re always thinking like an A.D.A. Between us we will get the evidence against McKee and see to it that justice is served.\"Alex teased \" I think that you did a pretty good job of serving your own brand of justice on that jerk yesterday.\" Then getting serious she added \" Walker we still have to find out who\"s leaking the information about undercover assignments and while we have a good reason to believe that McKee\"s doing it in San Antonio there was also someone else doing it here. Maybe we should investigate Olstead too, he seems to be tied to McKee somehow.\" Walker kissed her again then said \" Yes A.D.A. Cahill-Walker, we will investigate Olstead too.\" That earned Walker a kiss in return.Several weeks went by and Olstead was still demanding that assault charges be filed against Walker for the beating that he gave McKee but Captain Harland had a talk with the governor off the record and no assault charges were filed. Alex\"s friend came through with the police reports and it turned out that McKee had filed a report that stated he watched A.D.A. Cahill-Walker get into her car and speed away from the Debarge Garage. Gordan was able to obtain copies of the medical records from the San Antonio hospital. They stated that a Jane Doe had been found lying unresponsive in a alley near the Debarge Garage and was rushed by ambulance to the hospital for treatment. The discharge papers for the Jane Doe were signed by McKee. There was a copy of a notorized statement signed by McKee included in the medical records. It stated that the woman with amnesia currently known as Jane Doe was in fact his wife Danilee McKee. Trivette\"s contacts informed him that there was paperwork saying that Jenny Lind had quit her job but that no one could remember seeing her after that morning Murphy was killed. Based on those things they were able to get search warrants for the Debarge Garage and McKee\"s house. They were also able to get a secret wiretap on Olstead\"s phones and his computers. The warrant was served on the Debarge garage during which a shipment of drugs were found so they arrested the owner, Devin Debarge. After he made bail Debarge called up Olstead and told him that he had better get in touch with McKee and get him out of trouble. During the phone conversation Debarge said \" If only McKee would have allowed me to kill that nosey A.D.A. that day. But no he had to go and kidnap her from the hospital because he had the hots for her. Where she never should have been in the first place. You know instead of dumping her in the alley we should have thrown her in the dumpster. That way she would have died without anyone the wiser. Listen good Olstead if I go down for smuggling drugs for McKee you and he are both going down too.\"\" Just chill out will you? We have everything under control. The charges will be dropped against you. I promise. We have a federal prosecutor in our pockets, remember?\" Olstead answered Debarge who after complaining for a while longer hung up the phone. Several hours later Olstead was getting ready to leave his office when Walker, Trivette and Phil Holland entered it. He asked \" Holland why are those two Rangers with you?\"Holland replied \" They are here to arrest you on the behalf of the federal goverment. Gentlemen please arrest this man.\" Walker pulled out his handcuffs as Trivette read Olstead his rights. After the cuffs were secured Olstead said \" I\"ll make a deal Holland. If you drop the charges against me I\"ll tell you who\"s been leaking the information on the undercover agents.\"Walker answered \" Debarge already made us the same offer, thanks but no thanks. We already know that it was Mckee leaking the information in San Antonio and you doing it here. The federal prosecutor that was in your pockets has been arrested too.\" Olstead asked \" But how did you know about the federal prosecutor? No one knew that other than the three of us.\" \" Haven\"t you ever heard of wiretaps? We wiretapped you and all your communication devices. By the way Olstead should you and McKee ever cross paths again you really should tell him not to mess with Texas Rangers. If it wasn\"t for what he did to Alex we might have never be able to link him and you to the drug smuggling operation.\" Trivette said to Olstead who again tried to get a deal by saying \" I can tell you who killed Bruce Murphy.\"Holland replied \" We already know that Devin Debarge killed Bruce Murphy on McKee\"s orders and we also know that the woman who sped away from the garage in A.D.A. Cahill-Walker\"s car and plowed into that bridge abuttment was Jenny Lind. You know Agent Murphy\"s contact and not A.D.A. Cahill-Walker like McKee stated in an official police report.\"When McKee realized that he was about to be arrested for drug smuggling he grabbed a firearm and attempted to shoot himself but was stopped from doing so by Gage who was there to witness the arrest on behalf of his deceased friend. After he had kicked the gun away from McKee and the cuffs were slapped on Gage stepped back as Farley who had gone to San Antonio to make the arrest read McKee his rights.That night in their bedroom Alex looked over at her husband who was getting undressed to take his shower and told him \" Honey I want to celebrate tonight. Care to help me with that?\" Walker helped her with that."]}

Isten, she thought, and almost crossed herself. Then the anger came; and it pulsed and pushed at her every pore, only leaking out as cold sweat-the discovery, the confirmation; the outrage. She was not angry at Ludwig-she knew better. She was only angry at something...and that something held Gilbert\"s life in its claws. Der Führer?-no, he was not worth it. The Reich?-no, that was not enough. The people?-now, it could never be the people\"s fault, not to be spoken outright; they had fault, but they were the ones who suffered and were pardoned. But now, she knew. She knew what had slammed the great Prussia into a mold of tin, one so thin, yet so strong, only diamonds could even scratch it-solidity was not needed, but the soft, the formless. She knew what had created the stoic of a man she had fallen in love with-because she had, and that was all she could say of it-and had given her such a wholesome slice of epiphany, fraught with beautiful little fillings of emotion. This was what had shrouded the heated heart of a youth and elder-this was so obvious, and yet so obscure, and in the end all so ridiculous but so very real. Name it. Looking down at her dusty shoes, breaking the line of watching with the young German nation, she wondered. Who triggered such a crackle of change, such a complete rain of metal?-Ludwig, surely, for he was his brother. Roderich, perhaps-for without him, Gilbert had nothing to cling onto, as a sort of constant target of his ridicule. No fun, no rivalry-without Roderich, there was nothing but power, and even Gilbert wanted something other than that, much as he loved it. Even her. Elizaveta\"s fingers tightened about the slips of deathly paper, now gray with dust. They had been friends and rivals as younglings-they had provided for each other someone close but distant, something that was hateful, but something they would mourn if he died. Looking back up, she glared. Isten, she thought, staring at the hues of those blue, blue eyes, it\"s so powerful it can even affect Prussia himself. \"You pushed him into this,\" she croaked, for suddenly dust was crowding her throat; abruptly it was there, and she breathed it. Still, she pressed on, ignoring that dull pain and sharp crackles as she spoke, as she breathed. \"His people suffered so much more...\" \"I know,\" he said, slowly but quickly at the same time. \"I know...\" The last bit was a breath, and Elizaveta sucked in another dusty one for herself. \"But he loved you...\" Was that accusation in her voice?-Ludwig did not deserve this-perhaps he did, but who was she to judge?-she had seen him as a child, about as much as Veneziano. Bias was not to be directed at him, though he had done much to cause this reign of hell, and change. So much change... \"He hated what you were doing\"-and now she was stating the obvious-\"but he saw some hope in it. But all this has shown him-\" here, on strange impulse, she spread her arms, for the dusty sky \"-that it\"s a hopeless cause. \"And he suffered so much. His people...he cares about them as much as the next. Nation...\" She choked, then, realizing her mistake-tears welled in her eyes, and she stayed them for postponement. \"He cared about them,\" she croaked. \"He cared, and loved them as much as the next nation, but he shows it differently. Showed it differently. His character was unique amongst people, nations or not.\" Then she stopped. She did not need to ramble, to tell Ludwig what the both of them knew very well. Neither of them was foolish enough to be superficial, after all. Still, Ludwig stood, awkwardly, unblinkingly. Elizaveta blinked; those tears, those damned tears squeezed from the cramped space-one flowed down each cheek; with something of a huff that did not break the atmosphere, she swept them away with a hand. Her hand came away dirty. \"...And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts Into the lean and slipper\"d pantaloon...\" - Shakespeare PT: I\"m back from the Mediterranean, oh yes. I\"ll spare you the glorious, rambling details xD Anyways, sorry this chapter came out much later than expected-I sort of stalled a bit out of a slight shake of writer\"s block. And school -did- hold me back-three projects-one in which the meetings for it went horribly wrong-a Japanese test, a commission for my school\"s newspaper on my trip, Promotion Board (I FAILED, I MUST\"VE D8), and formal inspection. -Shifty eyes- ...Those two crack stories posted by my friends?-my computer had been taken at that time, so...aiya... Back now. The next chapter -should- make you guys happy~ And I am sorely tempted to ramble about recently learning to play the gu zheng, but the unnecessary mention is more than enough. -Bows- - Well, since I\"d already used Frau and Herr-and in one of my past publications, Xian Sheng-I\"d deemed it only appropriate that I write \"Ms.\" in Italian.

He\"ll come back later. - Next chapter is, in fact, second to last. And the movie, Red Cliff. Both parts. Go watch them. NAO. \"...With spectacles on nose and pouch on side, His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide...\" - Shakespeare Death was displeased. Spoiled brat that it is. And even after a gluttonous meal... This was a festival for one, after all, and that one was Death, was the bitter thought that ran through the heads of all. Damnation and hellfire to their enemies. The end was nigh, though. Elizaveta shrugged to herself as the Russians marched in and granted her liberation. Liberation-no, it was just some sort of sick version of abduction, and resistance helped little-was nothing but another wretched road, another battle to fight. Staring into grape-like eyes, she noted Ivan\"s berth, his mad, mad eyes. His uniform. His little grin. The gloating of a child. \"All will become one with Russia,\" he said, almost simply, his cheer eerie. Fists were already clenched; now they groped about, for a pan, a rifle, a sword-there was nothing. In some way, this brought her but a sigh of relief-Gilbert and Roderich, she was reminded, were not here to suffer as well. If Ivan put his giant hands on Roderich... Click, went an object, and Elizaveta was snapped into the world when her own instincts pulled her head away; on time, for Ivan\"s collar was soon found to be touching the tip of her nose: she went cross-eyed staring at the thing: it pinched her skin, now red with anger. How dare you- Oppression! No one could lay that yoke above her again!-she would never allow it! Even when a sort of purple shroud seemed to wrap itself about Ivan and blaze as a fire would...even as a faint eerie \"kolkolkol\" was thick in the air...Elizaveta held her ground-glaring, hating, repulsing. Oppression. No more oppression...! His eyes dropped; his hand followed: with a bolt of alarm-lechery?-feint?-Elizaveta took one step back, bristling as the wolf does. Watching the muscles of the Russian arms twitch, she ducked when he snatched at where her waist would have been had she remained still; with a quick flush of indignation, she glared upward; if only Ludwig had not been forced out! He had retreated with such haste, back to Berlin, offering to bring her with him, though knowing that she would not leave-Hungary was her, and her place. So he had left, alone and resigned to the fact that even Veneziano had to leave him, taken by the Allies. Elizaveta had watched him go with as much resignation. Endsieg, the Germans called it. Ivan was huge, behemoth above an ant...no, not an ant, but perhaps a lotus...perhaps a hybrid of that with a rose. There is no rose without thorns, after all. The Soviets had already been merciless, ruthless as the next army: the ache of rape and massacre fluttered about the land. If anything, the nation itself would fight. Useless as it was. Ivan dropped the collar. Still galvanizing with mental shocks down the spine, she watched closely. Too closely. Ivan\"s hand dove downwards and snatched. With a horrified she jumped back, giving a swift right hook to his neck, the closest she could reach. -And in the end, it almost didn\"t matter. Ivan smiled triumphantly as a long-forgotten weight was shifted from her belt. With a savage look from one of him and Elizaveta, the paper was in between his fingers...Elizaveta looked, stunned-in the moment it felt as if the appendix had been removed from her body. As useless yet familiar thing was there, the memory of its origins...filled with not blood, but gore-milk skin against the universe of deadness. The paper was scrolled about the Russian\"s fingers; somehow, it completed the image-a bloody Soviet, grinning wickedly as the royal purple billowed from his eyes: to top it all off, a dirty cream paper twisted about his raised digits. It was almost gray. She had long since forgotten about the thing; the small text, written in Gilbert\"s-a frantic parry-handwriting; out fell a finger, and it was the one from the bombed wreck. Just its weight-it had been there all along, useless, a little keepsake of Berlin; what she had seen there. What she had left behind for her own Hungarian version. It was white still, yet shriveled, and dry-that was all; it had changed, though not enough. \"German,\" Ivan said, warmly-no, coldly...swelteringly icy, and that was oxymoronic, but oxymoronic was practically the composure of him...him, all him. \"This is a finger from Germany, da?\" \"How do you...\" She sucked in a breath; refused to let her eyes widen. The grin widened; \"Just a lucky guess.\" He giggled, sickeningly, violet mist shrouding the remains of his person; his teeth were a white and perfect-they flashed in the buttercup sun, which laid its yellow upon the stiff white ground, touched with chill. Elizaveta stood stock-still then: she did the whole time; something had been torn away, and it lay resting among Ivan\"s grubby fingers, clad in leather-worn leather gloves that anyone would wear these days...she rubbed at her own, slightly shredded, at the still-clothed fingertips. Hands-they were worn down: hers and Ivan\"s. Beaten flesh. Looking up again, relief flashed briefly, the white light stark against her crimson crumbling heart, or else the mind-one was meaningful as the other; with that thought, of Roderich, Gilbert, Ludwig, Veneziano, and the war as a human, Ares... Endsieg. There was nothing to lose, but more lives. Eyeing the Russians, who had swept her land into scorched blood, she charged. There was nothing more to lose, and she kept on telling herself that. Even as the Soviets rushed over, rustling the paper with the breeze stirred by their boots; even as she lay ready to die, ready to live, tired as a nation at the end of his time. There was plenty of dust, and plenty of blood, and her body ached. It fit-it all fit. The yoke had been laid over her shoulders-the niggling thought that it was cracked brought no satisfaction: the Soviets still had claim laid over the land fought so hard for: Everything I\"ve done, she thought, as a cough formed within her throat, was for my people. Her thoughts flickered, at Roderich, at Gilbert-if she could not fight, she could marry, or give herself over; but she could fight, she merely needed the mentality rather than the plentiful physique: that was why she was in...this. \"Fuck,\" she breathed, eyes shut against the world. The last soldier soon disappeared through the limits of sound; peace and dust remained-not one stray man was left, no one else to strap the lead to her bones. Limbs aching, heart aching, mind aching, she lay there among the debris- No wonder, then, said the idle mind; she could have scowled, but it would have hurt too much-coughing did not help: if it stayed, it hurt the throat; if it was released, it cut the throat; the effort of checking it racked the whole body, and there was none of it anyway. Head lolling back, Elizaveta felt the paper, the finger, lying dead on the ground: Russia had dropped it, mockingly, to replace the grave flowers. There were no flowers, aside from those withered things in her hair. They were papery. Still, being near dead...the well of strength was dry. There was but moisture left in the moss growing upon the clammy stone-up the frozen cylinder it traveled, and so she flinched when the hand came. It was cold. Cold-and yet, hot as ice-white and freezing; the touch was familiar. It was light as a feather. The feather was upon the shoulder; it pressed, though not harshly; still, it could not be described as gentle. The hand was frail as her strength-brittle and cold and old. She refused to open her eyes then. She had decided, some time ago, that she liked the dark. She preferred it; it was friendly, and it allowed ignorance to be an excuse. It was kind, and she wished it could be a closer friend. But white-why white... \"Hey,\" said something, someone, something, someone. The ax scraped against the stone; it rasped with a familiar tinge of the past months, which were long as eternity, significant as the rest of time\"s children. It was a beautifully ugly voice, salty, bloody, white as fire. In the next moment there was nothing but one thing-it could not be. The pressure increased, it was beginning to hurt. Not able to growl, Elizaveta shifted with painful instinct-another cough ripped through her chest. \"Hey,\" said something again, and she summoned what was left of the moisture in the moss to flick her eyes open-it hurt: her eyes stung in white with water, but she knew it would come to pass. Everything comes to pass. Everything-absolutely everything: she had to keep on telling herself that, for though it passed, it took its very sweet time doing so; so that she could almost taste the bitter sparks on her tongue; it was parched, and thus drier. Spice. \"Fuck you,\" she whistled through her throat. It stung. It could not be. The pressure increased, not unexpectedly; it squeezed upon her shoulder, and it took a large muster of strength to finally blink the fluids away from the eyes, so that they were a clear green again-the first sight was white, as it always was-the second blink brought the sight of red, and some part of her-somewhere, deep down or hidden-despaired: agony nudged at her again, and she knew that those papers would not have been so kind as to let her go: no, she had to confront; it was a gift of something...that would not irk her for the rest of eternity, and yet a curse of more pain. The choice of selfishness or selflessness, when both loosed their boundaries and came together. And that hurt. More than anything, that hurt-the scorch of disappointment; denial, anxiety, fear-there was too much of it. And yet, she did not want him dead. It had taken her time, so much time to realize that...but she did not wish death upon anyone, having seen too much of it as the clock ticked away-she had never wanted anyone to truly die. Gilbert Beilschmidt, though she hated him above all, was no exception. But in times such as now, when war tore the world apart-when history decided to twist itself about-when the nations crumbled-how could death not be a blessing?-at this point she could almost want them all to be dead. Roderich, Gilbert, Veneziano, Ludwig...and yet she would watch with relief on the day that each of them would pick themselves up, and charge into the distance with life. She hated war. She blinked rapidly, staring, always watching; though she ached, she let the next batter of coughing come to pass-shock, it overcame her then. Charging upward, body screaming in protest, she could only slap him with strength that came by habit, before wrapping both arms around him, wondering how and why in hell- \"Get off me, woman!\" he protested, attempting to flail; she saw now that the tin had been stripped away, or at least most of it, as she felt him, flesh and cloth and hair-from the unhealthy pallor of his skin, from the dried hard uniform, to the pinked and browned hair, silver still shining boldly beneath the blood. He was unusually warm-hot even-when she felt him; clearly the cold had been warded off, though his hands still felt like ice; remembering the documents found in Ludwig\"s office, she realized that it was fever. But his head-feeling about the neck, she knew it was there-desperately feeling, just to know how cruel death was, she felt it, finding no seam-with a thin cry of joy and pain she kissed it, squeezing him till he was strangled- \"You\"re alive,\" she breathed, even as garbled speech flew from his lips. She was going into spasms-this was too unreal! And yet it was. He was so, so solid. His eyes were ruby. No petty pink glaze upon the Kingdom of Prussia\"s gaze-no death frosting them over. Clinging to him, something told her that she would never let go-a stupid little piece of wishful thought, no doubt: never let go, how ridiculous; and yet she did not release him, as he calmed between her limbs, resigning with guilty pleasure, rigid with denial. She could not even loosen about him-there was nothing but the jail scene playing and replaying itself in her mind-letting their hands drop, parting, and then the sickening sound of the guillotine\"s strike. Water, red, pink, silver, white, black. The swastika rose over all, as if to mock... \"Where in Isten\"s name have you been?\" she muttered against his shoulder, before lifting her head away hastily; still, though, she did not let go; she wanted to savor it. As the vampire feasts on blood. The scent of metal clung to him. \"Get off,\" was the obstinate reply; she lifted her hand and slapped him again, not knowing what else to do. \"Ow!\" \"Where\"ve you been?\" she said again. \"You were supposed to be dead-\" \"Well, I\"m so freaking not-\" \"I saw your head!\" she said, voice reaching a higher octave. \"It was a fake!\" \"Impossible,\" she declared, eyes widening before she finished; it came to her, suddenly-the way it had fallen, the sudden hush of death, the blindfold of stars, the blood-she had seen it, touched it, waded in the water it buried itself in.... She had suffered with him at death. \"You were dead...,\" she whispered; it gave way to coughing, and he only watched as she did; held onto her and she held onto him. \"I heard the thud. If you were dead-\" He grunted. When she looked up, his eyes were a bitter red. \"The head was fake. They...held me down.\" Scowling, he looked away; admittance was ignominy. \"They held me down up there. There were lots of them, Hungary-scheiße, there was a lot of back-up that we didn\"t notice; I couldn\"t beat off all of them. And my gun ran out...\" His voice faded; still, his scowl deepened, and he finished to his own satisfaction. \"Their leader was fun to kill though.\" He laughed, cruelly, forcefully-he found no love for death, though he had seen enough of it to mind less. Elizaveta decided against shaking her head-it could only be true; she had known him for years, since they were incomplete nations, just children running about with swords of both wood and steel. Just as he had sifted out her identity from that of Elisabeth Wertheim\"s, it was with ease that she found that this man in front of her was real: as nations in human form, they were allowed the same detached senses as those immortal. Stupid, she scolded herself, knowing not to trust so easily; but it was what it was. She noticed the shards of tin still upon his flesh then-of course, he could not have been thrown out so easily-time was needed, so much time; some things did not change, but could. They trapped him. Shackled his person. Still not releasing-he was too real, too solid, to let go-she let the glimpses of his uniform and body form in her mind; she looked about, saw the blood, the bruises, the sickly pallor of his skin. Dread formed with it, in a way almost instinctive, be it Gilbert or not: \"What did they do to you.\" It was not a question-it was an exclamation, asking, wondering, but not questioning. The papers came to mind again. A pause-it was too long, in Elizaveta\"s mind. With a ferociousness that came at will, that sapped her meager strength as well as supplied it, she asked, this time, demanded, \"What did they do to you?\" He was biting his lips, not speaking; still, obstinately, she took him by the shoulders again, harder, saying, \"What did they do to you?\" The papers came to mind again...how Ludwig had admitted it, how Gilbert had been so emotionless for the past year.... A protectiveness that she had never felt before, for but Roderich and Veneziano, but never this man, emerged; it reared its head menacingly-some maternal side of her glared outwards, and she shook him. \"Tell me!\" He only bit his lips harder. \"Tell me, God damn it,\" she said. \"I found documents in Ludwig\"s office. Is it true...\" he looked at her \"...that, throughout the war....\" \"Ja,\" he said, finally; his tone shook at the slightest, but was steely at the same time. His eyes grew hard. Elizaveta had never seen him like this, before the war-so close to tiredness, so close to a sort of trauma; he spread trauma, he did not suffer from it. She had known him for so long, and yet finally.... Not noticing how hard she was holding onto him, as if to crush him, she leaned in with complete urgency, green pools of eyes reflecting the cracked image of Gilbert Beilschmidt. \"Russia...hurt my people. So much.\" He snorted softly, in disgust. \"And der Führer\"-derision-\"doesn\"t like me a lot.\" The line along his brows became harsh, harsher than they needed to be. \"My people aren\"t West\"s. They\"re different. And they don\"t like der fucking Führer.", "SilverGray lll...YellowRagged llll...GrayMillie...CrowFeather ll SquirrelBramble lll...SquirrelAsh...TigerSasha...WhiteWillow SorrelBracken ll...StormSquirrel llll...LeopardHawk l...DaisySmoky CloudDaisy l...CloudBright ll...AshNight ...MinnowMouse BlueBarley l...FuzzViolet...MouseRunning ll...ShrewWhite l HawkPick a cat!

Anyway, I got a little carried away in the last pairing, what with all the shunning, pride, acknowledgement and prejudice; I think Naruto has gone way past into my head OO\" I\"m serious, at the first episode, there was all that attention stuff, loneliness, existence, blah, blah, blah and I was like \"Hey! That\"s exactly how I feel!\" Naruto has reminded me of the honor and determination I learned when I was barely over seven years of age, so I\"m addicted to it. Darren\"s Wings Thanks! Fuzz is a kittypet and his owner is a vet, well, I think the owner\"s a vet. The owner healed Barley and his sister. Barley\"s sister is Violet and their brothers, Snake and Ice, were Scourge\"s personal guards. You can read about them in Secrets of The Clans. Allan pike I totally agree. Love should not be forbidden! ANGELA Hm, nothing implies a love interest yet, but I\"m out on watch for it! HOLLYPAW, FALL IN LOVE! Yellowfang I\"m dying... The black is pressing on me, splotches of darkness appearing in my vision, blurring the image of the tom before me. Fireheart...the son I never carried. He was always a better son than Brokentail. Brokentail, traitor, murderer, someone I probably should not call a son, but I still loved him, because he was my flesh and blood. Mine and Raggedstar\"s. I\"m dying, my life is flashing before my eyes, letting me see the story I have looked at with my gaze. Raggedstar...was a great cat. I loved him, truly, I did. He was brave, honest, a great leader whom I have known for as long as I can remember. I can feel it, sense it, horribly, my breathing is slowing down. It\"s harsh, raspy, grating, like drawing a claw slowly across a bone, sunk deep. I\"m going... If this is dying, it is not horrid. It\"s actually...comforting, knowing that your pain will end soon, you\"ll unravel and reach up into the skies. So, this is the end. I hear those whispers, achingly familiar, Raggedstar\"s whispers, being pushed into my head, gently, flowing like a steady stream and I suddenly feel Raggedstar beside me. He has flown down, into my presence, to welcome me into the Great Beyond, to help me there, gently, knowing that we could love each other there without breaking a code. I have told Firestar that I had killed my own son, let him know of what has haunted me for what seemed to be forever. There is no need to look at myself as I leave this world. I could tell that my fur is burnt, dulled and I know that things will be better in Silverpelt. It\"s just like that. I dearly hope that StarClan will forgive me for all my wrongs. All these jabs of pain, invisible puddles of ice-cold wate, regret and terror, the warmth in my heart at being able to see the son I have never been the blood of...brings tremors to the body I have always inhabited. It\"s horrid: Patchpelt and Halftail, both dead. StarClan, keep them. There is some sort of consciousness beside me, warm, tingling. I can feel it, materializing. I feel that sudden warmth beside me, blow on my fur, as if to blow off the soot. Raggedstar? Raggedstar! I could feel that sort of warmth that comes up suddenly. I hear... I feel...his presence. It cannot be explained unless one feels themselves. I don\"t know, I just hear him now... No, it\"s like thoughts but...I\"m conscious of everything around me. I\"m caught between two worlds: this place I have walked physically and my mind, a mental place of its own. It\"s like thinking...but I\"m not losing concentration on this physical world. Thinking... I\"ve always defined it as feeling thoughts, but I\"ve never found the words to explain it before. The world is strange that way. There\"s a heaving mass of energy in my chest now, all in my sorrow, remembering how I\"ve loved Raggedstar, but couldn\"t, how he was happy that I was carrying his kits, how I had to lose my daughters right at their birth, how I had to stand to see my son throughout his life but never knowing his kinship with me, seeing him become a monster, losing Raggedstar and then killing my only son. Fireheart helped me... He brought me to ThunderClan and I found a new family. I found two new kits who did not share my blood: Cinderpelt and Fireheart. Now, I\"m going to have Raggedstar back, dear Raggedstar. I feel the warmth coming over me, so comforting and I suddenly invite it, with all the warmth I could muster for it. I hear whispers...coming in my head... Raggedstar... I close my eyes, slowly, because I want to at least see this world one last time... I do not meet darkness, for the first time, upon shutting my eyes, and the last time. I could hear Fireheart\"s cries to me...but I ignore them... I hear the sound, but not the words. To bask in my true son\"s voice...one more time. Good-bye... \"Yellowfang.\" I can hear the voice, that voice of Raggedstar, replacing Fireheart\"s. I find myself standing up, feeling like the time I had become an apprentice for the first time. I\"m all right now. I could see my body, a useless lump of dark, but I could see Fireheart. I turn, tearing my eyes away from him in his grief to see my beloved. There he is, the one I have craved to see. Oh, he hasn\"t changed a bit. As always, he is there, proud stature, with his unkept gray pelt, his thin tail high in the air, his proud amber eyes that always gleamed. I purr, find myself doing so, knowing that he is there. I see him again. I can. He is there, my beloved and I find myself padding quickly towards him. To feel him again...to tell him how much I love him, to know that he loves me. Peace at last. It comes to me and we\"re together, this time, knowing that it isn\"t against the code and not having to break apart again. We are together... ... Forever... PT: Please understand this. I have tried to put lots of thought into it. Er... Oh damn, now comes the part where I explain everything when I\"ve always been horrid at putting things into words. -Rubs temples- Sorreltail: Don\"t hurt yourself! PT: Yes, well, please review and vote! Plus, constructive critism! Sorreltail: C\"mon! See that cute little periwinkle button down there? It\"s waving at you! It\"s saying \"tickle me\"! PT: ...

Oh, yeah, I did have the time to write a new ONESHOT! It\"s for the Da Vinci Code, awesome book, no offense to any religions. I\"ve got no religion, so it doesn\"t hurt ME in any way, other than the fact that my divorced dad is Christian and I live across a Catholic church. Can someone tell me why Chinese people can\"t live in a home facing a church? I overheard it: some kind of superstition. It\"s got nothing to do with a graveyard, either. AHEM, well, to the point, now. Please read that oneshot! I\"m really proud of it! I know, it\"s just a fic, but I spent a whole night writing the draft. This is the first time I\"ve drafted a story OO\" Btw, people, what do you think of the people who constantly threaten people who write those \"ask\" fics for Warriors? I find it frinkin annoying. Sorreltail: Demi... -PT looks up at note- PT: Holy crap, that\"s a long rant. Darren\"s Wings Thanks again! OMG, I can\"t believe I forgot about Birchfall and Applekit! -Bangs head on table- Anyway, yeah, that fic on Katrina is brilliant! Love it! Silverstream So, this is StarClan\"s punishment. I\"m dead, now, but I can\"t believe it. I\"m dead. I repeat it, as if it\"s the only way to make it seem real. I\"m dead. No matter how much I repeat it, it\"s still unbelievable. How could StarClan do this to me? I love Graystripe, but I can\"t love my kits? I can\"t show them my love, be there for them? I stand here, with my mother\"s tail around my shoulders - all I do is stare at Graystripe, my kits, Fireheart, Cinderpelt and Tigerstar. Graystripe is wailing in grief at the body I have left behind. Oh, I so want to help him. I want to comfort him, but I keep standing my ground. It\"s the shock, the grief. I unconsciously unsheathe my claws and attempt to dig them into the incredibly hard rock beneath my paws. I want to feel this rock, feel the solid hardness, to feel it, reassure myself that, as long as I am touching the ground, that I\"m still here. Then, maybe I can comfort Graystripe. I want to stay alive. I want to watch my kits grow up, to see them become strong, fine warriors, maybe eben Clan leaders. Yet, most of all, I want to live to be with Graystripe. My claws scrape against this solid stone, not penetrating it. I insistently sink my claws in more. I grip the earth, because I don\"t want to leave - I can\"t leave. I can\"t leave! I CAN\"T LEAVE!! I DON\"T WANT TO LEAVE!! I can\"t leave! I don\"t want to leave! I don\"t want to die!! I don\"t! I DON\"T!! I WON\"T!! If I leave - if I die - who will take care of my kits? Father will be devastated! Mother\"s already died from blackcough when I was only an apprentice. I\"m the only family he has left. I can\"t just die and leave. He\"s my father. Crookedstar is my father and the only one I have left; I\"m the only one he has. I\"ll gain my mother when I join StarClan, but then my kits will be alone. They\"ll have no mother. Their father will be in a different Clan...if the kits won\"t end up as part of ThunderClan. Which Clan will they be part of? Why did I fall in love with Graystripe? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? WHY? WHY - did I fall in love with him? Why did he fall in love with me? Why did I? If I we hadn\"t loved each other, none of this would have happened. I wouldn\"t have carried Graystripe\"s kits. I wouldn\"t have to die - to leave the ranks of the living. To leave father. To leave RiverClan. Yet, what I mourn the most...is that I have to die and leave my love. My mate. My Graystripe. The handsome gray tabby, with those amber eyes that always glowed at me, always kind. Always the same amber eyes that held my gaze lovingly. Always. The eyes would always give me a deep feeling, penetrate me with a kind of warmth, a kind of love that penetrated, penetrated - penetrated me so hard - that it hurt. It killed me. Yet, I still invited that pain. I loved it. The pain told me how much I loved Graystripe. That pain hurt, but I loved it, hard. I loved it incredibly hard. I can\"t give it a name, but the pain came whenever I thought of Graystripe, and it hit hard. I invited it - I basked in it. It was probably love. Fierce love. A kind of love that was so painful in its own way, I loved it, that it was something good. A kind of pain that was good. A kind of pain that\"s not so painful at all. How strange. Many a night, perhaps a mere free moment, I would just press close to this tabby I loved. No one ever found out. I\"d gaze into those eyes, feeling that pain that didn\"t even hurt. I\"d press closer, feeling his warmth, feeling him. Feeling his love. He\"d press in closer as well and we\"d gaze into each others eyes. His eyes would stare at me, and I\"d stare back, lost in the amber depths. Lost. How I loved those nights, so fiercely, so hard. I\"d wish they\"d last forever. Oh, how I wish it were so now. I wouldn\"t be dying and leaving everything behind. I want Graystripe. I want him, even more as I stare at him hungrily. Him wailing with grief. My heart is shattering. It\"s going, the love and sorrow now drilling into me, this time really hurting. Not like that love that didn\"t hurt, but hurt at the same time. This pain... I feel myself pulling away. I open my mouth in a wail. My mother is guiding me away, on to StarClan. No! Yet, my limbs disobey me. They\"re going, obediently padding for StarClan. I stare at Graystripe. I can hear myself yowling his name, desperate, longing. \"GRAYSTRIPE!!\" He does not look up. Oh Graystripe, no. He just wails my name in grief and I want to be there. \"I\"m sorry,\" mother murmurs. I act as if I don\"t hear. I just want Graystripe. \"I know how you feel. I felt the same way when I died. I left you and your father alone. I\"m sorry this pain must be known to you as well.\" I barely hear. \"GRAYSTRIPE!!\" Graystripe No...Silverstream. I stare at Silverstream\"s bloodstained body through a blurriness in my eyes. Don\"t leave me! What will I do without you? The kits need you! Your father needs you! Your Clan needs you! I need you! Don\"t go, Silverstream!! I tilt my head upward; everything is a confusion of pain and tears. \"SILVERSTREAM!!\" I wail. That name, I repeat it: it\"s a name of a cat that I loved so much. It\"s like saying her name will do anything bring her back to me. I need her. \"SIL-VER...STREAM!!\" DON\"T LEAVE ME!! Please...DON\"T!! You can\"t be dead! DON\"T GO! Stay with me! \"SILVERSTREAM!!\" PT: There we go! Hope you liked it!! Sorry for missing out on updates TT.TT Good God. OH NO, THERE WE GO AGAIN!!

Btw, here\"s a note she wrote in case I knock her out: ED! Erm...sorry for the late update. I\"ve had slight writer\"s block that\"s been affecting the updating of a lot of my stories. The updates might get slower; it\"s been more than a month since I\"ve last updated. Please forgive me D: Go on my profile! At the bottom, there\"s a DeviantArt link. Click it!! It\"ll bring you straight to my deviation! Yes, I have a DA account now. I made a CrowFeather fanart on Paint. I wrote a fanfic thingy to go with it in the Artist\"s Comments. I\"m sorry, I barely had time to write it; I only had a few minutes. Three minutes, I think. I noticed that a lot of members of fanfic are part of DA. I found some...including some of you out there -Looks at computer screen suspiciously- shadilverluvr Like, HOW do they not make any sense!? I\"m sorry, but I lose my temper easily and, really, you should EXPLAIN how the oneshots make no sense. -Hope- In the Name of Love Yeah, she did spazz out. I was thinking dramatic and everything. Plus, there\"s the fact that Silverstream was young. I can\"t believe that she\"d be creepily calm about this. Darren\"s Wings Yeah, I know how to reply, but I prefer to do it this way. Unless you would prefer that I do it the way people usually do on FF. That\"s fine. Yeah, I\"ve read Flamestar Speaks: Flamestar\"s Forgotten Tale when I read your review. It really is great! :D I love the plot SO much, like OMG! It\"s so suspenseful and I don\"t mind if cats get too Mary Sue-ish! It\"s actually really perfect! Well, about the Da Vinci Code... This is rather unfortunate, but it does say some things disrespectful to Christianity. Yeah, you would have to read the book. Sorry :( On a brighter note, thanks for the constructive criticism and everything; I was really happy. In fact, I was practically jumping up and down in joy :) Feathertail I\"m dead. I\"ve been dead for a while now. It\"s been a couple of moons, I believe. You lose all sense of time up here, in this place. I\"ve gotten confused. It\"s nice up here with StarClan. It\"s certainly good that I know my mother now. She\"s wonderful. I feel safe and free, a kind of bubbling warmth in my being-but my problems aren\"t over. I\"ve seen Crowfeather, still alive, living as a WindClan warrior. I\"m proud of him-proud that he\"s such a good warrior...but... It\"s just that...he\"s with Nightcloud. It\"s just that-I know Crowfeather doesn\"t truly love her. He tries to, but he mated with her in the first place to prove his loyalty to WindClan. I feel for him, but whenever I look at Nightcloud, I have an urge to yowl in her face. A heat boils up within my being; the heat of anger wells up and struggles to escape me. I\"ve never let anyone know how I feel-not even Silverstream. Nightcloud...she loves Crowfeather, but she\"s selfish, arrogant and incredibly possessive of her mate and kit. She treats Leafpool unkindly, trying to tell her that Crowfeather\"s hers. Can\"t she understand how she feels? How much pain Leafpool had, and is, going through? Cold guilt fills in my chest to hate Nightcloud, but I can\"t bear her at times. Does she not know how lucky she is-she is Crowfeather\"s only mate who is allowed to stay with him. I am dead; Leafpool is bound by loyalty. Loyalty to her Clan, the warrior code, loyalty and guilt for Cinderpelt. Oh, Crowfeather-so confused, hurt, filled with pain. The pain is with me as well. I don\"t regret trying to save his life with mine, but I wonder if it was worth it. Would it have been better if we had died together? This thought horrifies me. But, if Crowfeather had died as well as I, he wouldn\"t have to experience the pain coursing throughout his body-would he? I\"ll never know. Yet, I still so want to bring him up with me... Is that selfish? Crowfeather... This pain of watching him going through what is going through now-him hurting, while I\"m up here, hunting with StarClan, not able to do anything about it. His heart has broken, and it cannot be mended. I wish I could fix that. I need to fix that. I cannot sit by, knowing that he\"s dying within himself. But, it\"s too late to help now. I\"ve lost him...in more ways than one. PT: So...short, but my head\"s going through extreme writers\" block now. I mean, seriously! I\"ve gone off my usual updating schedule on my other Warriors fic and I\"ve been going through tons of drafts for the next update of my FMA fic. That\"s not to mention my CDF fic, my...well, you get the point. I\"ve noticed that I\"ve been bashing Nightcloud and ShadowClan too hard. Mark me, I don\"t like them, but ShadowClan\"s just too arrogant and Nightcloud is.... Well, I just read Cats of The Clans and I feel the same way as Rock feels about her. Except, there\"s the fact that I think she really does love Crowfeather, but hurts that he doesn\"t love her back. ShadowClan\"s amazingly proud; I still haven\"t forgotten that they just watched and jeered while Berrypaw was still a helpless kit caught in a fox-trap. I\"m still amazingly mad about it. If I don\"t update real soon, you\"ll have to wait a while. Summer just started for me here in New York; today was the last day of school. My aunt just called today. I\"m going back to Canada this summer. It\"s not Toronto for once. So, yeah, I won\"t be back for a while. I\"m going to update my other fics and tell readers that I\"m going to be off for a while, unless there\"s a change of plans. You never know with my family. Well, see ya. P.S. I GRADUATED DESPITE MY BAD MATH GRADES!! I\"M GOING TO EIGHTH GRADE! W00T!!

Tara got up as well, the sound off that sentence had made her do that. \"What is it, you know you can ask anything off me.\" \"This my dear might be to much, but I will tell you and then you can decide for yourself.\" The reverent mother turned and looked at her before gesturing with her hand to sit down.

He had told them that if they ever need help they should come to me. Now I have not spoken to my brother in many years, I did not even know where he was. But he was and still is my brother and I would not refuse his boys help if they would come to ask for it.\" The reverent mother paused for a second. \"Last night, we were woken up by two men at the door. They told me that their father had given them this address in case they needed help. And they did need it indeed. They are here now, staying in one of the sister\"s cell\"s but they can not remain here. You know the rules off our order, men are not allowed to stay within the walls of this sanctuary. Not even if they are relations to us, no one but you knows this, I have not told them either. They did not seem to know who I am and I do not know if it is my place to tell them.\" Again the reverent mother paused and looked at Tara. Tara got up and walked over to the woman. \"You want to ask if I can take them in?\" \"Only for a short while, until they are ready to move on again. They assure me it would only be for a few days.\" The reverent mother said. Tara thought about it for a while as she looked upon the older woman standing in front off her. How could she have guests? She had to go to work tomorrow! Thinking of work, what kind off trouble were these guys in? If it was serious what should she do? She was after all still a cop! Where would she put them? How could she ever refuse the reverent mother anything! \"They can come and stay with me for a few days, they would have to sleep on the couch and a stretcher but they can stay.\" Tara said eventually. The reverent mother looked upon her with a smile. \"Than you, I will take you to them.\" She said guiding Tara by the hand. Tara followed silently, wondering to herself why on earth she hadn\"t listened to the little voice in the back off her head?\" \"Connor, you awake?\" Murphy asked looking at his brother lying on the small bed. \"Aye.\" Connor said his eyes still closed. \"We can\"t stay here for long, you do know that don\"t you? These are nuns, we can\"t drag them into all off this.\" Murphy said pointing at the door. \"I know! I talked to the reverent mother and she said she would try and find us somewhere else to stay.\" Connor said now looking at his brother. Murphy sat on the wooden chair leant forward, his hands folded in-between his wide standing legs as he looked at Connor. \"How do you think Da knows this nun anyway huh? We show up in the middle off the night with you like that and she just puts us up.\" \"Doesn\"t matter does it? If Da would have thought we should have know he would have told us.\" Connor said now closing his eyes again, he wished they had let Murphy burn his wound shut. Instead they had insisted on cleaning it and dressing it tightly and now was hurting something fierce! The door opened and the reverent mother walked in making Murphy shoot up out off his chair. \"Hello.\" \"Hello, how is your brother doing?\" The reverent mother asked. \"Ok, as good as can be expected.\" Murphy said offering her his chair. \"No thank you.\" She declined with a small smile. \"I have come to tell you I have found you a place to stay.\" \"Great, we really didn\"t have anywhere else to go, cause then we would have never...\" Murphy started but was silenced by the reverent mother raising her hand. \"Its is alright, Tara would you come in please.\" Tara walked into the room and looked at the two men now in front off her. \"Tara this is Connor and that is Murphy.\" The reverent mother gestured from one to the other. The look off the both of them made Tara\"s senses tingle a little. There was more to these two then met the eye. \"Got any last names?\" She asked looking at them critically. Connor wanted to respond to that question and had already pronounced the Mc part off their name Murphy shot him a look. \"McDonald.\" Murphy said quickly. Connor raised his eyebrows as he looked at his brother, what was he playing at? Murphy looked from Connor to Tara\"s waist, there a police badge was clipped to her belt. Connor nodded and lay back down. \"Tara has graciously offered to let you stay at her house for a few days.\" The reverent mother said looking at them. \"My apartment actually, but yeah.\" Tara said smiling at the reverent mother. \"That is very nice of you indeed.\" Connor said trying to get up again but his leg was bothering him to much. \"Aye.\" Murphy complied looking at her, he knew they could not turn her down. But he did not like the idea that she was a cop. \"Well Tara came here on foot so you will have to follow her later.\" The reverent mother said smiling a bit. \"I should go and do some shopping.\" Tara said thinking about the empty cavern that she called her fridge. \"I should be home around 7 here is my address.\" Tara handed Murphy a piece of paper. Murphy looked at her. \"We\"ll se you there then.\" He said smiling a little to not make her suspicious. Tara walked out off the room and the reverent mother lead her to the door. \"I again can not thank you enough.\" The woman said taking her hand. \"You are very welcome, I will see you in a few days.\" Tara said kissing the hand that held hers and walking out. As she made her way down the street to the store near her house she thought about what she had just done. Things could go wrong on so many levels and in so many ways she shuddered at the thought. Connor looked at Murphy. \"We can not go in to the house off a cop! Have you forgot we are wanted in Boston and quite a few other places?\" \"No I haven\"t! But what else do you want to do, huh? We can\"t stay here either these are fucking nuns! You totally went of the deep end when Rocco held a priest at gun point. But now you want to stay here and dump all the shit after us on a bunch off nuns!\" Murphy made no attempt to lower his voice although Connor did suss him. \"Well then we won\"t stay here but we won\"t go to that Tara\"s place either.\" Connor said trying to sound convincing. \"And how fucking far do you think you can get with that leg?\" Murphy asked sarcastically. Connor sank back into the pillows, he hated to admit it but Murphy was right. \"Fine we will go there, but only long enough for my leg to heal up a bit.\" Hello all!

Chapter Two: The next day. \"The wound is for you, but the worry is for me.\" At exactly five minutes past 7 a taxi stopped in front off the building where Tara lived. Murphy helped Connor out and the both of them looked up. \"You ready for this?\" Connor asked looking at Murphy again. \"Ready as I\"ll ever be.\" Murphy said hoisting his brother up against his own body a bit more. Opening up the door to the building they each saw the stairs that were there and the obvious lack of an elevator. Connor let out a groan and Murphy swore in a way that would have made one of the nuns at St. Lucy\"s draw a cross. Tara stood looking at the folding bed in the corner and the stack off sheets on top of it. What was she doing? She had always had a weakness for the reverent mother, but this was crazy! She was going to have two men in her house she knew nothing about. She walked over to her bedroom and checked the drawer containing her extra gun. Her other was safely strapped to her belt on her back, concealed by her shirt. Tigger was skulking round, like he knew that there was something coming. Murphy practically dragged Connor to the door as he tried to wipe the sweat of his face with his free hand. \"She just had to live on the 5th floor!\" He sighed as he leant against the wall. Connor just sighed in response, the way up the stairs had tired him out in a way he had never imagined. Murphy took a deep breath and then knocked on the door. Tara looked at the bed once more and then went to open the door, as she did Murphy and Connor practically fell in. \"He needs to lie down.\" Murphy said pointing at his brother. Tara gestured to the couch and Murphy lay Connor on it before looking up at her again. \"What is wrong with him?\" Tara asked giving Murphy a pillow to place under Connor\"s head. \"He...... His...... He hurt his leg.\" Murphy eventually said. He did not want to tell her the truth. Connor and he had decided to keep her in the dark as much as they could. Even though the reverent mother had spoken highly about her, there were only very few people they would trust and fewer of them were police officers. \"Ok.\" Tara said looking at him with her eyebrows raised, if he thought she would be less suspicious now he was way off base. Before she could say another word her cell-phone rang, she walked to the kitchen to grab it off the table. Murphy sat down in one of the arm chairs and looked round the room, just as his eyes glided over the couch a big ginger cat jumped on the edge of it. Glaring at him it sat down like it was its throne. Murphy looked at it, it had a fat body and it\"s hairs stood in each direction but the same. The cat\"s face looked like it had a run in with a door, the door having come out the victor as the cats face seemed to be as flat as could be. \"Man you\"re ugly, what is your name then huh?\" He asked not taking his eyes of it. \"His name is Tigger, I have to go out for a while.\" Tara said walking back in from the kitchen. \"So much for my night off.\" She said grabbing her jacket of the back of another chair. \"There is food and drinks in the refrigerator I might be late. If there is anything you need me for my cell umber is next to the phone.\" Tara closed the door behind her with mixed feelings, those guys were now in her house on their own. She had removed anything she thought was wrong for this situation and for the first time in years she didn\"t even have so much as a beer in the house. She looked at the door once more and then made her way down the stairs, her car was still at the station so she was going to have to walk over there first. Murphy watched her as she walked out of the door with those last words. Tigger jumped of the couch and made his way to Murphy\"s feet, just as Murphy leant down to pet him Connor opened his eyes. \"I wouldn\"t do that if I were you, remember what happened the last time we got to close to a cat?\" Murphy looked up with a grin. \"Technically that was Rocco\"s fault, if he hadn\"t hit the table...\" He paused at the memory and shook his head. \"Yeah well I don\"t think Tara would take loosing her cat as simply as Donna did.\" Connor said looking at him. \"Aye.\" Murphy said smiling some more. \"But then again she doesn\"t look like the type that uses drug either. I wonder what exactly she does at the police.\" Connor said, his face mimicked his thoughts. Tara looked round the office she was standing in, chalk outlines marked the floor where the body\"s had been lying. \"So what happened?\" She asked looking at the investigator picking bullet casings of the floor. \"What does it look like? They had a tea party and the tea cosy blew up!\" The man sarcastically said. \"No need to get all touchy here.\" Tara said crossing her arms. \"Sorry it\"s been a long ass day and it looks to become an even longer night, this place is a mess. I\"ve got casings from at least 9 guns, only four off which are of the same make. I have been at it since they cleared the bodies out, but I reckon I have a good few hours left before I have catalogued the whole scene.\" The investigator returned to his work and Tara walked over to a uniformed officer standing in the corner. \"You found them?\" The young man looked at her, he was a white as a sheet. \"I...I did.\" He said in a weak voice. \"Ah a first timer, please tell me you have a partner.\" Tara said recognising a rookie who had just seen his first dead. The guy nodded and pointed towards the door, where an officer she knew at Tommy Shannon walked in. \"Shannon, what happened?\" \"A derelict office building with four cars parked outside it for two days is bound to get you a call. We got here and found five of them on the floor shot to bits. Junior here didn\"t take to well to that.\" Shannon showed a smile as he nudged his head toward the rookie she had talked too. \"So we called in the coroner, the investigation guys and you lot.\" He gestured round the room. Tara looked at him again while a fellow detective handed her five pictures, she skimmed through them and smirked a bit. \"The shit is going to hit the fan now, these guys are all Tony Scoresy\"s men. I\"m not talking pion\"s either, these are some of his heaviest hitters.\" She handed the pictures back. \"The captain is just going to love this!\" \"Actually detective I am not having that much fun!\" Her captain boomed behind her. \"We need to find out what happened and we need to do so now! If Scoresy even suspects another collective or syndicate had anything to do with this, people are going to start dropping like flies.\" The captain leant against the desk as he looked at her. \"Why are you staring at me? There are more of us you know.\" Tara said knowing what was going to come. \"Yeah but you are the mob expert.\" He answered back, air quoting the word mob. \"Look I just got here, all I can tell you now is that these guys.\" She grabbed the pictures out off the other detective\"s hand and threw them on the desk. \"Are not your basic number runners, they came here with a purpose. Now I can go out and squeeze every informant I have but still I might just have a hard time getting any information. If these guys came together they did so for a special reason, they all run a different part of Scoresy\"s operation. They don\"t work together at all!\" Tara was frustrated, as she would get when not in the know of what could have happened. The investigator got of his feet and put his tools down for a moment. \"All I can tell you is that who ever did this was good. As far as I can tell it was an open-the-door-shoot-everything-you-can-hit job. But they did take the time to close the eyes of the dead and place pennies on them.\" He put his hand in his case and pulled out an evidence bag which held coins. \"I have been on the job long enough to tell you that your basic mob hit man doesn\"t do that. Some off the more classy ones might, but they would never go for the approach used here.\" Tara took the bag and looked at the coins, this sounded familiar but she couldn\"t place it. \"Chances of prints?\" She asked. \"Slim too none, I can tell you where each off the other guys has been without a problem but the shooter or shooters is a different story.\" The investigator shook his head. \"Oh isn\"t that just great! Call me when you get something definite.\" Tara said handing him back the coins as she started to walk out. \"Where are you going Callahan?\" The captain demanded to know. \"I\"m going to squeeze some dirt.\" Tara said looking back for a split second. Murphy put the remote control down and looked at Connor as he lay there with his eyes closed. His face was flushed and every now and then he flinched of pain. He had moved his brother onto the folding bed, hoping he would be a bit more comfortable. Although he would not admit it if asked he felt helpless, Connor was in pain and there wasn\"t much he could do about it. He sighed as he leant back again, Tigger was spread out on the couch beside him and purred a bit. Raising his hand to take a drink from the can in his hand he looked at the red colour of it. He needed a stiff drink and all he had been able to find was a soda. There was a thud a mans body hit the wall. \"Mario, now you know I really don\"t like it when you lie.\" Tara grunted at the guy she was holding onto. It was a good thing this snitch was a feeble little shit or she would have never been able to do this. \"I swear on my mother I have no idea what you are talking about!\" Mario said looking at her, little pearls of sweat on his face. \"Come on Mario! The top shelf of Scoresy\"s men get bumped off and you are telling me no one knows why!\" Tara tightened her grip, trying as best she could not to breathe in too much of his nauseating cologne. \"They don\"t! Word on the street is that Scoresy is pissed as hell and he is pulling out all the stops to find who ever did it, but no one knows!\" Mario sounded closer to whimpering than to speaking. Tara lowered him to the ground, this was her third informant and none off them had more news then that Scoresy was pissed and no one knew who was responsible. \"Can I go now?\" Mario asked hesitant looking at her as he pulled his shirt back in place. \"Yeah, but remember...\" Tara started but Mario cut her off. \"As soon as I hear anything you will be the first to know.\" He said hastily making his way towards the end of the ally. Tara sighed, this was getting her nowhere, she would just go back tot he station and check if the reports for the coroner had been done yet. Then she would go home. Murphy looked at the phone again as for the 5th time that night it rang. He wondered if he should pick it up. He shook his head and decided not to, who ever it was they would call back. As soon as the phone stopped ringing he walked over and pulled the cord out off the wall, not wanting it to ring again and wake up Connor, who had finally fallen a sleep. Murphy had taken off his shirt and was spread out over the couch, he had been trying to fall asleep but had yet to succeed. He sighed and closed his eyes again when he heard the click of the lock. Thinking it was Tara returning he got up. Tania walked through the door of Tara\"s apartment, the lights were off so she might not be there. She had decided to come over after she had finished her shift, to see why the phone had gone dead. She hit the light switch and walked in only to stop dead in her tracks at the sight of the half naked guy in front off her. \"Who the fuck are you!\" She grabbed her backpack and pulled out a small canister. \"I could ask you the same thing.\" Murphy said looking back at her, he moved his foot slightly to see if his bag was still there, the bag that contained his guns. \"Where the hell is Tara?\" Tania asked walking in slightly. \"She went out for a while.\" Murphy answered following her every move. Tania surveyed the room and then saw a second person on the foldout bed. \"And who the hell it he!\" \"Look why don\"t you just calm down.........\" Murphy said raising his hands slightly and looking at her. \"Screw you! I wont calm down until you tell me where Tara is and who the hell you two are! Don\"t even think about moving this is pepper-spray!\" Tania said while moving to the chest of drawers close to her, is she wasn\"t mistaken Tara kept a spare handgun in there. \"What are you doing?\" Murphy asked still looking at her. \"Just stay where you are.\" Tania said looking at him and then at the drawer. Tara walked up the stairs and heard voices, she first thought that her neighbours were having a fight again but then she recognised Tania\"s voice. Quickly she started to run up the stairs. Walking in on Tania still holding the can and Murphy looking at her. \"What is going on?\" She asked looking at the scene in front of her. \"You tell me!\" Tania asked looking at her. \"Where the hell have you been? I\"ve been trying to call you all night! And who the hell are they?\" \"Put that down.\" Tara said pointing at the can in Tania\"s hand. \"They are staying with me for a few days. Murphy meet Tania.\" Tara said looking from Murphy to Tania. \"They are staying for a few days?\" Tania asked looking at her best friend. \"Can I talk to you for a second?\" She nudged her head toward the kitchen. Tara followed Tania into the kitchen and sat down in a chair. \"What is going on here?\" Tania crossed her arms and looked down on her. \"Nothing, I had tea with the rev. And she asked me If I could take them in for a few days.\" Tara said hating to have to lie about the reality. \"The rev. Asked you to put these two up? So why didn\"t you call me?\" Tania was stunned.", "\"You don\"t feel that way,\" the other boy whispered, voice hoarse. Shito had no idea how to respond. He didn\"t move when Chika\"s head fell, his forehead nestling right in the crook of his neck. He couldn\"t find his voice to tell him to get off. He could\"ve said it felt wrong, but how could it possibly feel wrong when his entire life was wrong anyway? Eventually, even the wrong became right. \"Tch, that was worth nothing.\" Chika scowled as his katana disappeared and they traded hands again. \"What did you expect?\" Shito twisted the wrist so it would fit properly onto his arm. \"That took us less than two minutes.\" \"Totally not worth the effort...\" \"That\"s one hundred yen less for us to pay off. Kita-san wasn\"t even around to help.\" Shito looked down at his right hand, and scowled. \"You dirtied it. I\"m going to the convenience store.\" \"What? Why?\" \"Because it has a washroom, you idiot.\" \"Why can\"t you just wait \"til you get home? Afraid your socks will bunch up if you run?\" Sometimes, Shito was certain that Chika existed just to annoy the hell out of him. The frown was set on his lips the entire way to the nearest convenience store. He stalked straight to the back, where the men\"s washroom was. \"You\"re so OCD all the time,\" Chika continued as Shito washed his hands. \"You always have to be perfectly clean, those stupid collectables in your room can\"t even be a millimeter off, you hate it when people touch your stuff...\" He calmly turned off the water and grabbed some paper towels, and wiped his hands clean. Then, turning towards Chika and stepping towards him, threw a punch straight at his jaw. \"Ow! What the hell, you bastard!\" \"You deserved it.\" Feeling satisfied, he adjusted his collar before making his way out of the washroom. That was, until Chika pulled him back and delivered a punch of his own. He was like a kid. Shito couldn\"t understand him. One minute he was perfectly calm, and then next, a tornado of frustration and anger. Where was all of this energy from? Where could he possibly get it? But maybe he understood a little-because that very same tornado was feeding his own energy right now. \"I can\"t wait \"til I actually get to kill you-\" Chika caught his punch singlehandedly, catching him off guard. He frowned in distaste. The fight was over for now. This time, Chika won. But when Shito made a move to pull his hand away, he didn\"t let go. \"What do you want,\" he said shortly, glaring at the other boy. He could only handle so much of his mood swings. \"I want you to tell me\"-his face loomed closer-\"every single thought that crosses your mind. Starting now.\" \"What the hell are you talking about-\" \"Everything. It might be the random thoughts about how one strand of your hair is out of place, or how sexy I am-just everything that crosses your mind-say it.\" If you don\"t step away from me, I\"ll kill you, and is a strand of my hair out of place and you\"re disgusting, your breath is condensing on my face and stop getting closer and I swear to God if you don\"t let go of me, I\"m going to rip out your spleen and shove it down your throat and don\"t you dare smirk at me like that and-oh, okay, maybe you\"re sexy, just a little...wait, no! The kiss was tentative and soft at first, until Shito bit Chika\"s lip. Hard. The other boy looked absolutely livid-and kind of stupid, really, with his bottom lip coated with his dark blood. \"I swear to fucking God...\" Shito\"s expression was unreadable. It was hard to display any one emotion when even he wasn\"t sure what he was feeling. \"If you swear too much, even God won\"t save you.\" But both of them knew that there wasn\"t a god out there for them. Chika kissed him again, rougher this time, with enough force to drive Shito backwards and slamming against the walls of one of the stalls. The sound of the collision echoed in the washroom, and all he could really think about was how revolting Chika\"s blood tasted and how he had to situate his feet shoulder width apart just so he could keep himself upright and how Chika took advantage of this and had his thigh press against his crotch and- His hand gripped the other boy\"s jaw so hard, he could\"ve broken it if he applied a little more pressure. \"Touch me again,\" Shito hissed, voice dangerously low, \"and I will not hesitate to kill you.\" Because killing was the only thing he was familiar with, and what more could he do when he was in unknown territory? \"Chika-kun, I bought the sushi you wanted!\" \"Oh, thanks, Gopher. This looks so fresh! Do you want to share?\" \"Really? You\"d let me? Thanks!\" \"Only if you pay for what you eat.\" \"...That\"s a bit much, don\"t you think?\" Michiru glanced over at Shito, who was careful not to make eye contact. \"Shito-kun! Would you like to have some sushi too?\" On a normal occasion, he would\"ve accepted grudgingly, or said something like, \"Looking at that guy immediately makes me lose my appetite.\" But today wasn\"t a normal occasion. Actually, since the washroom incident a week ago, nothing had been normal anymore. Things had been tense between him and Chika, and it had become increasingly difficult to work with him while they were hunting zombies. So instead, he settled on, \"Thanks, but I don\"t feel like sushi today,\" and left the kitchen. He couldn\"t face Chika when he had no idea how to respond to him. \"I\"ll count to three. If you don\"t move by then, I\"ll kill you.\" Chika scowled. \"I got here first, you pathetic excuse of a zombie-wait your turn.\" Shito was not in a good mood. It was becoming harder and harder to actually wake up with a good mood at all. \"I was here first-you just stepped in front of me like the insensitive lowlife you are.\" \"The last time I checked, this bath was meant to fit more than one person. I don\"t mind sharing.\" Normally, Shito wouldn\"t have minded either. But with what happened at the convenience store, he wanted to take some precautions. He was sure that Chika got the hint, though-when he told him to back off, he sounded so convincing, even Shito was beginning to believe himself. \"No,\" he said flatly. \"I\"m going first. I feel disgusting.\" \"There you are with your OCD again. Just share, you priss.\" But he really was feeling disgusting, and he didn\"t want to waste anymore time arguing with him when he could be cleaning himself. So he scoffed, brushing past the other boy and entering the bathroom. He quickly stripped off his clothes and placed them in one of the little cubbyholes, proceeding to the cleaning area with his toiletries. He could hear Chika following suit. While both boys were soaping up and shampooing their hair, an awkward silence fell over them. Well, it might\"ve not been awkward for Chika, but it was awkward for Shito. \"Stop treating me like I\"m scum.\" Chika\"s voice echoed in the bathroom. Shito barely hid his snort, pouring water all over himself. \"You are scum.\" Goosebumps rose on his skin from the lack of warmth around him. \"And stop treating me like I\"m a child, too.\" \"You are a child.\" He didn\"t understand why Chika was telling him these things. He\"d always treated him this way-what made all of it so different now? (Something in the back of his mind knew, but he didn\"t want to acknowledge it. The thought that Chika might actually like him was...far too alien for his liking. The taste of his blood was still lingering on his tongue, and he hated it.) \"I\"m seventeen, Shito. Living alone and taking care of myself for a lot longer than you take me for. I may act like a child, but that doesn\"t mean I am one.\" \"Stop taking everything so seriously. It\"s weird.\" Standing up, Shito moved onto soaking in the actual bath. He usually stayed there for long periods of time-it relaxed his muscles and helped him think. On more than one occasion, Michiru had entered the room without knowing that he was still in there. \"I\"m just trying to be a bit more like you.\" He heard some splashing, and a minute later, felt the ripples of the water as Chika entered the bath. Shito cracked an eye open to his right, feeling far too relaxed to glare. \"Don\"t sit so close to me. It\"s creepy.\" When he glanced down into the water, he could see Chika\"s submerged hand-almost as if he wanted to reach for something. But he pulled it back. The other boy didn\"t respond, but he didn\"t move either. So Shito did the liberty and moved instead. But Chika only sat closer to him again. \"Stop that,\" Shito growled, snapping his head towards him. Chika\"s eyes were half-lidded and hazy-sleepy, almost. \"Stop what?\" His voice came out languid and...oddly sensual, actually. It was weird. Shito tensed when he shifted, his head coming to a rest on his shoulder. No. This was wrong. This was so wrong. \"Get off me,\" he said quietly, but his voice lacked the threat it usually had. He was just so tired. Tired of arguing with Chika, tired of thinking of how to deal of Chika-he was just tired of Chika. Chika tilted his head, lips pressing against Shito\"s jaw in a soft kiss. Shito couldn\"t describe it as anything-not uncertain, not needy-it was just a kiss. He closed is eyes, but his brow furrowed. He was sure Chika noticed. Somehow, this bath just wasn\"t as pleasant as it was supposed to be. Beside him, Chika shifted (probably thinking that his silence was some sort of acceptance, that dumbass), and one of his hands came to a rest on top of Shito\"s. He kept very still. Chika should\"ve been heavier, but because they were both submerged in water, he didn\"t feel much of his weight when he sat on Shito\"s lap. And it wasn\"t in much of the innocent way a girl would, either-he was unashamed as he faced him, legs spread and on either side of his body. \"You don\"t have to do anything, y\"know.\" Chika\"s voice came out uncharacteristically soft. \"I can do all of the work.\" \"I\"m not having sex with you, if that\"s what you think.\" Shito carefully kept his eyes shut. He was afraid of what he\"d see if he opened them. He was afraid of what new feelings might surface if he saw what was shining in Chika\"s eyes. \"You\"re a zombie, Shito.\" Lips pressed against the corner of his mouth. \"Not a corpse. Your body still responds to stimuli.\" And coupled with the warm, almost hot water, Chika\"s touches did have a bit of an effect on him. His hands massaged his shoulders, rubbed his arms almost soothingly-but he did nothing blunt or straightforward, as Shito assumed he would. Chika didn\"t actually kiss him. He suspected he knew why, considering what happened the last time he tried. But he found himself wondering what it\"d be like to be kissed under these circumstances-almost wanting to be kissed. And this was the point, Shito thought to himself mildly, where he lost his sanity. He found his breath hitching when Chika\"s hands tentatively ran down his sides. \"Do you like this?\" Chika\"s breath was hot against the shell of his ear. \"Shut up.\" He had far too much dignity to admit that it didn\"t feel bad. \"Can I kiss you?\" He hesitated momentarily. \"No.\" But Chika took his pause of uncertainty as a yes, because their mouths were pressed together in the next moment, and oh God what was he supposed to do? Their lips were clumsy against each other, but neither of them had ever been graceful together. Shito found his hands clenching into fists at his side. It would be so easy just to relax and let it happen...how long had he been fighting against the current for? The evil voice in the back of his mind whispered maliciously, Too long. And so he let himself sigh a little when Chika\"s fingers pinched his nipple. He couldn\"t risk opening his eyes now. He could imagine the smirk on the other boy\"s face. If he saw even the smallest hint of evidence that Chika was the one dominating, pure instinct would make him shove him away. The heat in the room was almost intoxicating. Their tongues meshed together, slow and lazy and maybe even a little sloppy. It bothered Shito, but not enough for him to fix it. He couldn\"t quite place how Chika tasted-but it was certainly better than his blood. He kind of tasted like...regret and purpose and drive all rolled into one. And maybe a little like cookies. He couldn\"t be sure. Chika took his time. It was only once he had enough of Shito\"s mouth did his hands move down lower. Shito froze at that, hands clenching Chika\"s hips in warning. \"I am not stopping,\" the other boy said determinedly. \"I\"ve come too far to stop now.\" But he was anything but harsh when he touched Shito\"s member, which was still soft. Shito never imagined it to be like this. He would die before admitting that he wondered what sex with Chika would be like, but the few times he did, he\"d always thought that it would be rough and inconsiderate. He\"d thought that there would be violence and curses and blood involved. \"I feel the need to point out that if you don\"t breathe, you\"ll die.\" Shito breathed. He tried not to sigh when Chika\"s hand ran along his length several times. His grip relaxed on his hips, but he never really let go. It was a lazy sort of action-by the time he was at full arousal, he could feel Chika\"s half hard member pressing up right against his. Was it wrong to think that it felt erotic? It was more of the fact that it was Chika than anything. If he was with a woman, or even with Otsu, he wouldn\"t respond this way. He was sure his body wouldn\"t be so hypersensitive to anyone\"s touch but Chika\"s. It was because he spent so much time trying to avoid him or predict when he\"d next attack him that even now, when he was sure Chika wouldn\"t rip off his penis (at least, he hoped he wouldn\"t), instinct made him aware of everything that was happening. \"Look at me.\" Chika\"s wet hand came up to brush away his stray locks of hair, still damp. \"Shito. Open your eyes, dammit.\" Shito shut him up by reaching for his face and pulling him into a kiss. He couldn\"t look. He just couldn\"t. As they engaged in a small tongue war, his hands went below the surface of the water again, and hesitantly touched Chika\"s erection. There was a distinct pause in the other boy\"s movements, before he continued on as if nothing had happened. Shito scowled against his mouth. They were about the same size. Bastard. \"Didn\"t think you\"d be kind enough to get me ready\"-Chika\"s voice came out embarrassingly husky-Shito\"s cheeks flushed for him-\"but I\"m good now.\" He then shifted, and his hands hooked the joint beneath his knees, and- \"Absolutely not.\" Shito\"s eyes flashed open then, in a full-on glare, and he pulled his legs back from Chika\"s hands. \"I am not letting you take me.\" Chika blinked, looking hesitant. \"Well, you could top, if you like...\" Wow. He really must be horny to not put up a fight. \"Nothing is going up anyone\"s ass. That\"s unsanitary.\" \"Sex is pretty unsanitary in general, Shito.\" \"Which is why I don\"t do it.\" His eyes narrowed, and Chika stared back, unwavering. Then he grinned, situating himself in Shito\"s lap again, grabbing his erection in the process. Shito hissed, eyes narrowing. Chika\"s grin was unnerving. \"Whoever can make the other come first, wins.\" Which, Shito thought, clearly put him to a disadvantage, because Chika had been touching him first, therefore meaning that he was aroused for longer. It was obvious who was going to come first. But that didn\"t mean that he wasn\"t going to try. This was stupid, he thought. Not just stupid-it was wrong. What happened to the hatred between them? Where did it go? Where was the Chika he had known for months? He took Chika\"s member with no hesitation, giving it a few firm pumps. Chika mirrored his actions on his own shaft. They both stared each other down, and there was the first flicker of fear in his mind. This was what he wanted to avoid. Chika was alive. His eyes burned with this intensity that Shito couldn\"t remember possessing in the last couple of decades. Although he was bound by that black ring around his neck, although he was a zombie-if he was defined by his soul and nothing else, then he was human and thriving and clearly outshone Shito by a thousand light years. And what was he? A monster, that was what. He gritted his teeth and shut his eyes again, but the damage was done. The image of Chika\"s face was engraved in his mind now, flashing and permanent behind his eyelids. It was like a chain reaction-igniting some sort of explosive and burning along the wick-and it\"d inevitably reach the core- He tried not to think about it. It was all he could do now. It didn\"t take him long to realize that Chika mirrored whatever action he did. If he swirled his palm over the head of his erection, the same happened to him. He could manipulate his actions so he got the most pleasure out of it-but he wasn\"t sure if this was a good thing, because that meant he was going to come faster. \"Shit,\" Chika muttered, forehead resting on the curve of Shito\"s neck. He felt so much hotter than the actual water around them. \"I\"m close.\" Those words were enough to make Shito\"s grip on Chika\"s erection tighten. Maybe he\"d win. But what was the prize of winning? He didn\"t know, and yet, he was determined to win anyway. \"Don\"t stop.\" Chika\"s voice came out throaty. \"I\"ll kill you if you stop.\" Experimentally, Shito\"s free hand reached out and massaged one of Chika\"s sacs. The result was almost immediate. Shito flinched when Chika bit him, teeth digging into his flesh. Now, this was a wound he couldn\"t ask Yuuta to heal. Chika\"s entire body froze, his grip tightening on Shito\"s erection in the process. Shito could imagine his face-the way he looked back when Shiba betrayed him-but maybe ten times more pained and at the same time, a hundred times more pleasured. This was something Shito, and no one else could do. \"You\"re useless,\" he snapped, swatting Chika\"s hand off of his own erection and pumping himself. His own breath became labored, and when Chika finally went slack on top of him, he felt another hand close on top of his, guiding him along. Chika\"s tongue swirled lazily over the wound that he had created, and he wondered if he liked the taste of his blood. It wasn\"t supposed to be an earth-shattering orgasm at any rate, but somehow, with the thought that Chika was sitting on him, that Chika was touching him and Chika\"s tongue was licking his skin-it seemed to amplify it tenfold, and his back arched into the boy sitting on top of him, eyes screwed shut and toes curling. A low groan involuntarily escaped his throat, but he didn\"t even have time to be embarrassed-Chika\"s fingers were brushing across his nipples and came up to cradle his face, waiting patiently as he drifted down from his momentary high. \"That wasn\"t too bad, was it?\" It almost sounded like he was mocking him, but his eyes were too soft for that. Those eyes were his demise. Shito felt fidgety, still breathing heavily. \"We need to drain and refill the tub. It\"s absolutely filthy now.\" \"Shush, don\"t ruin the moment.\" \"There is no moment. Get off.\" But Chika didn\"t listen-something he was so prone to do-and his hands went into his hair, almost-dare he say it-stroking it. \"Such a spoilsport.\" Lips kissed Shito\"s brow, his ear, his cheek, his jaw line-and finally his lips-something he was unconsciously anticipating. He responded to Chika\"s touch in a way that kind of disgusted him (why Chika, of all people?)-but he found a warm feeling swelling in his stomach that made him kiss back more earnestly than he\"d like. He pulled away, although a little reluctantly. \"We really need to change this water. And wash again.\" \"Shouldn\"t you be more concerned with your prize?\" It took a moment before Shito to remember that he had won their little contest. \"What\"s the prize?\" \"Mm.\" Chika looked unnervingly comfortable, sitting on his lap. \"You can do whatever you want with me for a week.\" His lips curved into a sly grin, and Shito wondered what he had in mind. \"Midnight, my room.\" Chika\"s grin widened. \"Ready for round two?\" \"No. We\"re sleeping. You\"re not allowed to come over until everyone\"s asleep, in case people get the wrong message.\" \"It\"s not wrong if it\"s the truth.\" \"It\"s not. Now get off me before I kill you.\" It was a little cramped in his bed for two, but despite that, he found it a lot easier to sleep. Chika\"s warmth next to him made him relaxed and content in a way he never knew was possible. When was the last time Shito had been content? He didn\"t hesitate to punch the other boy in the face, though, when he reached out and grabbed his crotch. owari. A/N: I changed my mind. There is absolutely no plot whatsoever. (I was so disappointed to find only five M-rated fics with this pairing. So I contributed to it. Now there are six. :) I haven\"t written in this fandom for about...two years. The last time I did, I don\"t think I grasped their characters properly-did I do better this time? :/ OMAKE \"Chika-kun...?\" Michiru watched her friend in question. He had a pink, flowery apron on, and a bandana on his head, pushing his messy locks back. \"What are you doing?\" \"Cleaning,\" he muttered, clearly angry. \"Shito-kun\"s room?\" \"Unfortunately.\" She glanced into the room that belonged to the other zombie, and found Shito sitting there on the bed, happily reading a book. \"The dusting\"s finished.\" Chika leaned against the doorframe, crossing his arms. Shito looked up from his book, glancing at Michiru for a moment before a small smirk spread across his lips. \"Good. Now do my laundry for me.\" \"I hate you.\" Something told her she didn\"t want to know."]}

Slowly, hesitantly...but coming from Gilbert Beilschmidt, it was achieving the impossible-it was landing on the moon to touch and scrape the unmoving dust. He placed his hands on the thick bed for leverage, leaning forward as she did, and they kissed like they really meant it. Unsurprisingly, they did. Blood. Pulling away, they both held their respective stances. \"I did,\" he said. \"Now talk.\" Elizaveta stared again, though it was thoughtful, ready to comply; no pride, mere coolness; pensive. Gilbert Beilschmidt. He was staring with that look of acceptance and yet still life; that look like the one quietly watching his partner leave without wanting to hold them back. His right cheek was aflame, and there were silent shadows of gray beneath his eyes, which were rubies of hell. Perhaps there was stubble around that jaw so used to clenching, but that could not be for sure-he was young and yet so old, and had never been able to grow a beard for the life of him. \"All right,\" she said, and she talked. \"...Made to his mistress\"s eyebrow. Then a soldier, Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard...\" - Shakespeare PT: Ohoho~ I wonder if that means I\"ll be speaking Japanese with a Kansai accent~~ ...sans the \"han.\" - In the case of writing style...well, I\"ve been told by Cheri-chan of a different fandom that my writing style reminds her of Edna St. Vincent Millay; my English teacher at school has commented upon observation that my writing style reminds him of JD Salinger. I\"ve read neither person\"s works (I\"ve been trying to get Catcher in The Rye, though...) and would like some opinion upon my style...because I think I\"ve been trying to follow Victor Hugo and Harriet Beeche Stowe\"s styles for a while now. - While plastic technically did exist years before the World Wars, I still prefer to use tin; and the imagery I imagine would appear in reading would perhaps be more appropriate. - Beards. Kuskuskus~~~ Oh God, I should stop thinking of so many inside jokes xD Ahem, well, beards. ...Well, young as the nations are...the men -should- naturally have facial hair...-backhands France- I mean, physically young...they probably all shave it or something, but I took this opportunity to sort of play around with Prussia\"s age. ...And I like Yao\"s girl-appearance. - Tomorrow is the beginning of March.

I\"ll be updating at least once before I leave. - Have you noticed the new change they\"ve made here on FF? D: The poor quotation marks...damn it ;_; Why the quotation marks? \"...Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel, Seeking the bubble reputation...\" - Shakespeare Elizaveta felt the abrupt snap of cold over her wrists and did not wince. This was her reward for speaking. \"Standard procedure,\" Gilbert said, almost apologetically (but that would not be Gilbert then, would it...?). \"der Führer\"s\"-he made a face-\"orders. He\"s Gott-damned furious.\" Elizaveta merely shrugged; she was going to jail, and though she detested oppression, she accepted it. She had mild support, and the act was complete; her people were at least all right-aside from those in the camps, to her disgust-and there was not much to do. She wasn\"t helpless-she was merely there. And afterthought was added when she said, calmly, \"So der Führer\"s going to see me?\"-and her own mockery surprised her; she felt no emotion to be noted; it must have hidden itself in the ashes. Like Gilbert, she was wiping clean the stone tablet and crowding the words in moss. She thought the Prussian smiled, bitterly or wickedly, but could not see. He was behind her. There was an awful feel to the knowledge that one\"s hands were cuffed behind their back; Elizaveta felt it not, for it would soon be over. She was not to be humiliated. At least Gilbert had been gracious when she asked for time to clothe herself; it only took a period of time for her to let consciousness of exposure drag itself back into her mind, for she had come across a lack of shame. The Prussian was such a femme fatale in reverse and hell-those red eyes suited him. The green uniform that had been so painstakingly snatched and zipped from Hungary overnight was his doing-a miraculous feat, and for something so trivial; the soldiers ordered to do so deserved merit and more. Green felt good for wear. If only there was a rifle. She had slipped the crumpled paper from the pocket of her jacket to her military outfit\"s pockets. The artificial yellow of her hair had been washed while changing-it was strange but familiar, to see her hanging locks of brown. She was no longer an Aryan-no longer a fake. No longer an actress, nor Elisabeth Wertheim. Elizaveta and Gilbert walked again with admirable cadence, bearing and posture woven to look alike; people stared, murmured to one another; this was expected, and phenomenal. There was shock and outrage, and once Veneziano could be heard crying in the distance. And still Elizaveta remained cold, proud; unhindered, but postponing care for the boy she mothered. The stares drew her poor contempt, for she had known these people. It did not hurt ut it was not to be ignored either. The halls and atrium echoed as a void. And ah, der Führer himself. Standing with the ridiculous mustache and parted dark hair-oh, Aryan, of course, Elizaveta taunted as his gaze met hers; green on brown, not blue. Frosty hate chilled her veins as the Hungarian walked and neared. There was fury in those eyes, and perhaps madness...then again, what was madness? Egotistical, ran through Elizaveta\"s mind. Hypocrite... Der Führer raised his hand; Gilbert paused to reply, intoning, \"Heil Hitler.\" That echoed throughout the room in the voices of many before Gilbert nudged her slightly; off they went. That was that-the first and last meeting between Hungary and Adolf Hitler. The next time would be when she was there to look at the body, look, once. Those eyes could not meet hers then. The cells were cold, stony, gray, and that was expected. The footsteps were pitched patters like rain. When the door was open, Elizaveta glanced around-tiny windows to the booth-like cells were empty, not filled with curious faces. Abruptly she met the gaze of her Prussian companion, elevating to her toes to kiss him on unmoving lips, with a crooked whisper of \"auf wiedersehen.\" Frowning at the lack of reaction she tried again, sans words; not desperate, but unsure. He replied this time midway, kissing back with lips like death, sans blue. \"Ja,\" he said quietly, so unlike him; and yet still... He undid the metal cuffs and Elizaveta felt the rush thickly back to her hands, filling her fingertips. They stood awkwardly for a while, before she reached out and clasped one of the white hands firmly; her nails scraped lightly over the rough palm and scarred back, feeling the throbbing blue veins pressed against skin. Unlike Roderich\"s soft hands, made for but the piano. Cottony, cottony hands. Elizaveta held it for a while in silence, remembering the tiny hands that she should have held at least once in faraway childhood. They were adults now, and that label seemed almost far-fetched. A few months were a long time, if they could lead her to savor the warmth of a rival hand, one she would have wanted wet and hot with running blood-not the very much dry bit of heat for her to lean into. Was this Lady Fate joining with Madam Irony?-and Father Time? Suddenly Elizaveta realized that she didn\"t want to let go, but she did anyway; she let it drop. Focusing on her nemesis\"s calm face, she backed into the prison. There was but a hard bed that was more of a table, but she did not mind. Roderich had no luxury-save disconnected notes-nor did Gilbert-save the new era-so she could fare, with a burden, repenting like one old and dressed in sack. For a split second, in the light painted gray, Gilbert\"s feature\"s shifted for a formation of wistfulness-then vanished as they both nodded-soldiers, comrades, enemies, and lovers, agreeing. \"See you after the war.\" \"Ja.\" A pause-then the door was closed, slammed in its weight. Enclosed in gray solitude, Elizaveta stared at the window of light. Closing her eyes to shut out the physical tunnel vision, listening to the Prussian\"s unbreakable steps, she looked to the future, for insanity or else the end. One week. Or was it two? No matter; she needed to find something else to check her sanity, lest it fly out and latch itself to the walls; then she wouldn\"t have it, and never get it back. To think she\"d lost it-perhaps this was a process beginning in short bursts. Confinement is a dull subject to chronicle-it only informs, and unless there are assassination attempts involved in the story, it should be but recorded in brief-or else, the excitement should be rushed to at once. And how it happened on a day when, mouth dry, Elizaveta remembered that she was a country-how ridiculous that she should. She was the very embodiment of her people-she knew that, but these little bursts of epiphany came rarely-she was a country, the representation of a land and a people. Only then did she realize it-through the responsibility, the struggles and fire and flame-that she had missed out...on something. She was sure that she hadn\"t, but perhaps she had...perhaps, a friend instead of a lover. Roderich was a friend, but he lacked... Still, she loved him beyond most people and things in the world. Throughout the hardships, while Gilbert had laughed and taunted her, going on to stand alone-alone-he had spared kindness, despite the times she had beaten him in childhood, so that he could barely even move. And what did she have in the end? She realized then and there-that Gilbert, for all his struggles to become a nation, had only one candy bar; he had only just that, because something was clinging onto him, or else the entire store...he was at his last throes for life. Perhaps it was fate or horrible history; but he was but a state now. The great militaristic Prussia of freethought, once an empire-über alles...now a pitiful free state knuckling under the Third Reich. And still he fought. He had nothing but the crumbs of chocolate lying on the ground now, snatched by the birds. That troubled him not-he could shoot them out of the sky. Only he was onto his last rock. Tracing idle circles into the hem of her beret, she moved onto fiddling with them, waiting for the next meal...food came twice every day, and she wasn\"t in the least bit hungry when it did; but it was something to focus on. She had wondered, sometimes, on the concept of confinement aside from humiliation and harsh treatment-now she knew for sure that the boredom was part of it, and more than significant. At least Turkey\"s home was not so. She spat at the thought, but immediately regretted it; the film of dust and dirt over the floor and walls was filthy enough. And she thought she felt sick-there was fever ailing at her skin. Fatigue troubled her not, but the discomfort helped less; she had picked at the cut on her side, even, just to feel something other than burning numbness-which was ironic, as it was numbness. She coughed again; Isten, was her trail of thought, these conditions are probably worse than they look. Oh, she was fussing about in the case of hygiene-but it was practical. Gilbert and Roderich both would approve. Joy. And she had soon learned that there were no other prisoners-probably executed, she thought darkly. She did not waste her time wondering whether she was to follow them or not. A slot opened, revealing a thick trickle of light-oh, finally, she thought, disgusted-she could\"ve killed for some water, what with the sandy hollow that was her throat. The tray slid in, and then the light was gone; at least it had sealed away something to help her. She noted the poor quality as she reached for it, glancing at the subjects-something that resembled mashed potatoes (she would rather not know), a cup of stale water. Good enough. The water washed down her throat, half of it then gone with the one gulp. Elizaveta didn\"t wince at the sourness of the liquid. How long am I to stay here, she thought, disgusted still. Isten, this war can\"t go on forever. She choked a bit from her position in sitting on the table of a bed-this didn\"t feel right. It never did, really, but she somehow felt worse than before; her throat was swiftly drying already. Arsenic poisoning? she thought dryly, but not seriously; then she realized that she had hit the nail spot-on. The explosion at her apartment... The White Rose was practically dead, if not nonviolent... She was a nation... With a horror-filled look at the tray, she shoved it away with amazing strength; it crashed against the solid wall, its contents spilling over the corners. She couldn\"t stay here. Not with people after her life, not with her wavering health. Fiddling with her beret she began choking, practically feeling her innards disintegrating. She was practically spewing sandy fire. This was how the nation Hungary was to end! This was how the woman Elizaveta was to end! This was how the actor Elisabeth was to end! Dust clogged her throat; she thought of only Roderich, and of Gilbert. Others ran through her mind-Italy, dear Veneziano...Holy Roman Empire, who was someplace else now...Turkey, to her flaming fury...Ludwig, the soldier...and Magyar, who was gone and still strong... So this...this was how dying felt like. This was the blanket of dark was to come, and she leaned against the filthy wall, breathing hard; the wheezing scorched her throat. Then-salvation. A door opening, blinding light finally rushing in, squeezing in to illuminate the pathetic, miserable grayness. She couldn\"t see-she thought it was heaven, for her thoughts were steeping into foolishness; the arsenic and decided to kick her, right when she had uncovered its presence. Swearing at Lady Fate and Madam Irony, Elizaveta felt her will to scream die in her papery throat. She couldn\"t die...not yet. She was a nation, and she was going to see this Isten-forsaken war to the end, come what may, and hell to pay. Even if the hounds themselves snapped at her heels as she outran them. And then-an angel. She swore at it too, told it to get away, she didn\"t want to die yet. Her fiery will was returning, and she had not even noticed its absence. \"Get away,\" she growled at the angel. \"I\"m not dying yet.\" \"You won\"t!\" growled back the angel, whose voice was that of a demon. But Elizaveta was not to be fooled; she knew what deception was, after all. \"I can\"t die yet,\" she snarled, rabid. Choking on her fevered breath, she ranted on. \"Get back, take me when I deem it fit enough! I\"m a nation, I have people! I can\"t die just because I was stupid enough to consume toxic!\" She flailed at him, with a fist that was nearly as good as her pan. She wanted it to leave. She wanted it gone! \"What the hell!\" the angel-demon snapped, and grabbed at her wrist; Elizaveta jerked it back, choosing instead to aim a kick at the presence. \"You\"re not here to die!\" he continued hurriedly as he side-stepped the sure-to-be-fatal kick. \"I\"m here to get you out, Gottverdammt!\" Then it hit her. \"Gilbert?\" She held back her fist, just in case, ignoring the insistent tugs of the unconscious. \"Ja.\" He panted, stepping forward, out of the blinding light. Oh. Dropping the fist, letting go of her energy, she looked at him, studying the face for any changes-it was screwed up with a clear message-\"What?\"-and the stubble was more pronounced, unless it was Elizaveta\"s own prickling delusions; his eyes gleamed still like rubies, but the shadows were clearer. She almost felt sorry for trying to hurt him-almost. She needed to explain, there and then: \"Someone\"s been putting poison in the food...\" She gestured at the mess in the corner, not adding the \"I think.\" It was hard to remember that it was only speculation. Then, abruptly, and not quite out of left field-she felt the suppression of exhaustion press against her, full-force; she did not quite lose her consciousness, yet, but it was nearly there- It attacked again, like a hound. \"Damn it,\" she hissed at the pain; she gripped at something of a stitch in her side, regretting that she had been so bored as to pick at it; it only added to her agony. \"Damn it...,\" she growled again-then there was white. Her fingers slackened and there was the snowy white. Not black, but white. She wasn\"t quite unconscious-just tired. Gilbert supported her, mumbling beneath his breath about what a burden she was-her own reaction was but quiet pensiveness-did she want to punch him or smile? She was sure by now that he was sinking back to what he was before the war. And beyond; it was what was beneath-Elizaveta was not superficial. Her feet dragged slightly, but her small attempts at a fine gait helped at the slightest; at least she could walk. And the wound in her side was once again dormant; it was not to bother her in some time, though it stained the green fabric of her clothing. Beyond that, she was stunned that the Prussian had come back for her-he had said himself, \"after the war,\" if she could trust him at all. Perhaps there was something of importance-maybe her people needed her. Maybe they were bombed; maybe it was not arsenic that was trying to sap her strength, maybe it was an attack. But they were escaping. Of that she was sure. \"Where\"re going?\" she almost slurred. A pause, and a glance...\"Back home. To Hungary. Your people need you.\" Ah. So she was correct. Home. She had never been one to truly appreciate it-home, to her, was something else-someplace where she was with her people, free from oppression, or somewhere listening to music with Austria. She did not feel homesick, but she almost did-nearly, almost; months away from her land, playing a game with the enemy while Europe collapsed through and through. Keeping back a groggy tone, she plowed on-almost tripped-\"Have I been attacked?\" She could have been anxious; and her heart did skip a tiny beat. She wanted the answer to be no, and yet still yes: no would mean safety, yes would mean assassination. Gilbert was silent for a moment; uncharacteristically; he was hiding something beneath the tin. \"Nein...,\" he then murmured; his tone was hesitant. And why...? Elizaveta, her arm already slung lightly around the back of his neck, reached her hand; flexed her fingers. It was beneath his shoulder, and each and every one of the little digits curled around his uniform once she had pulled her arm up with slight effort. The khaki had been cooled by the chilly night air, and the only source of warmth was his bare skin. The pads of her hand skimmed over the shoulder ranks-signaling Hauptscharführer-before they settled. This was not romantic; this was practical, and natural. \"What?\" she muttered; she wanted to know; needed to. What had happened? She waited, impatiently, for news of her land. Her heart skipped another beat. He still did not speak, even as the pressure of Elizaveta\"s hand pressed the bottoms of his ranks against the thin shirt beneath, pricking his skin. She had strength even when uncalled for; that was to be noted. Lifting a hand to pry it away, and without breaking his pace (they were soon entering a staircase), he said reluctantly, \"The commies are headed toward us.\" Elizaveta stared at him; she had heard right, did she not? Ignoring the way he was opening her clenched fingers, she asked, \"How...\" \"Strategic.\" It was then that she noticed the darkening of those ruby eyes-clearly, there had been some serious side of him that was rarely seen, and entirely doubtless of sanity. Or else it was a mere spawn of this newness to the tin. Dropping her voice without realizing it, she asked, \"...How bad would it be...?\" Now his fingers tightened-around her fingers still, they seemed to freeze still; worry. The tension weighed heavily in the chilly air. He spoke at the same level she had: \"It\"s Russia. You should know.\" Instead of answering, Elizaveta chose to let her head tilt back to take in the sky-they had climbed out of the stairs without realizing it, and the burst of cold air-real air, not stale and cramped-was insistent in reminding them. There were stars above; not scant, but the myriad was generous to the black velvet tonight. Suddenly Gilbert tensed; she felt it, for he stopped immediately, and his hand tightened. Immediately his right hand reached for his belt; the clear air was cold as fire, crackling with alarm. One of them spoke, as Elizaveta, clearing her throat, dropped her head back to look around and at him-\"What-\" Whipping his pistol from his side, Gilbert immediately shot at the right with the focus in his eyes flaming, as if this were a swordfight. Elizaveta immediately wished for one herself as she heard the cracking bullet fell a soldier-one man was revealed in death, as he clutched at the gaping black hole in his chest: A perfect shot.", "\"Let\"s go,\" Raimondo said and then started in the direction of the prison. The rest of the monks shrugged and followed him. They haven\"t gone more than 5 yards when, out of nowhere, a stand just appeared. The monks screamed, then stared at the sight before them. The stand was all yellow, with a giant sombrero on the top. The sombrero was yellow as well, with zigzags, green and red, around the spot sombreros usually have zigzags. On the front of the stand, a giant steaming taco bore the sign, a giant, neon red sign: FREE TACOS Omi yelped in delight. \"There really are tacos here!\" he squealed. The taco guy in the stand stared. Not really becoming of a Shoku warrior. Omi rushed up. He didn\"t have any breakfast today, being woken up by Dojo at 4:54A.M. for the new Wu. The monks followed him silently, too stunned to speak. \"Two tacos please!\" Omi said excitedly. He squinted at the menu next to the taco guy. \"Chicken tacos! Parrot style!\" Omi beamed. Omi happily chomped on his taco as his friends stared at him. Dojo exploded from his spot on Clay\"s hat. \"SHEN GONG WU!!!!!!!\" There was another shriek from our favorite cheeseball. He lifted his head. There, clamped between his teeth was a blackish silver shurikan, its four sharp points gleaming. \"The shurikan star!\" Raimondo yelled, plucking the star from Omi\"s mouth. Kimiko made a face. \"Yes!\" Dojo yelled, obviously relieved that measles won\"t start randomly coming out of his scales. \"Let us suck this taco stand!\" Omi yelled triumphantly. (Crickets chirping) \"Uhh...yeah...right...\" Kimiko muttered. \"LET\"S BLOW THIS TACO STAND!\" Raimondo yelled, ignoring Omi\"s scream of \"That too!\" Raimondo took the Yin-Yang Yoyo from his pocket. \"Yin-Yang Yoyo!\" As the newly made Shoku warriors left the inky kanji world, the prisoners were sure they\"d be bored again. No one thought they\"d returned again, that the unthinkable would happen as evil started to grow inside one of the monk\"s hearts. TO Be Continued... PT: Right, a cliffhanger at last! Hope you like the next chapter, when there will be more action! Including SHOKU POWER! Yay! Please comment! PT: Chapter 3 is up! I have a slight writer\"s block so some suggestions would be welcome. Plus, owing to the fact that I may be one of the youngest writers on fanfic net (I\"m not sure. I\"m 13; really), I have a State Test next week, so updates will have to wait awhile. There\"s going to be a fight scene in here, but I\"m bad at those, so please don\"t kill me! I\"m sorry! Anyways, enjoy! It was like any other day. Master Fung hadn\"t called the monks in for training yet and the monks had finished their chores. So the warriors were sitting around. Kimiko was playing Mindcreeper and Clay was wrestling a pig. Omi and Raimondo were pretending to play Steal the Wu. Dojo lounged lazily in the sun, feasting on barbecue and hot sauce. What could break this peaceful moment of idling? You\"ll see... Master Fung stepped into grounds, where the monks were hanging out, followed by a 12-year-old girl. \"Young monks,\" he called out, catching the monks\" attention at once, \"We have a new warrior among us.\" The monks immediately gave the girl rapt attention. She was unusually tall with black hair in a ponytail that streamed down her back. She had hard, black eyes and something about her face that said \"Don\"t mess with me\". Her frame was wide hips, a muscular back and broad shoulders. In short, she scared Dojo. Well, he got scared easily anyway, so whatever. When she spoke, she had an unusually quiet voice. \"Hey.\" She was American. \"Ooohhhhhhhhhh. Did mine ears play games with me? A new warrior?!\" Omi gasped. \"It\"s true,\" the girl said, \"I hail from Flushing and I\"ve been training myself in street-fighting and climbing since I started to jump too much. I went learning Kung Fu and Jujitsu when I was ten. Master Fung invited me here telling me that I\"m supposed to become a Shoku warrior with four other warriors and use the element of thunder. My name\"s Drew Werd. You\"re the monks aren\"t you?\" \"Yeah,\" Raimondo stated \"By the way, are you really good enough to be a Shoku warrior so soon?\" Drew glanced at Master Fung uncertainly. Master Fung gave a small nod. \"SHOKU WOLF, THUNDER!\" Drew yelled as she jumped in the air. Blue lightning crackled and swirled in the air and landed in her palms. Her shadow became blue as well and crept all over her. In short, Drew looked like a lightning spirit. Drew looked at some boulders and trees nearby. Focusing, she made a dive for them and swiped. There was a slight flash as the boulders were reduced to a heap of dark ash. Drew landed neatly in front of the monks and looked at Raimondo. \"O.o\" (Crickets chirping) 5 minutes later... \"We\"ve got a new Shen Gong Wu!!!!!!!!!\" Dojo yelled as he slithered into the Wu chamber, where Master Fung was presenting Drew\"s signature Wu, the Eye of Dashi, to her. \"What\"s the Wu?\" Kimiko asked as she fingered the Star of Hanabi lovingly. The monks rushed off to the grounds as Master Fung bid them farewell. Dojo grew to his 40-foot form and the monks jumped on. Drew lodged herself between Kimiko and Omi. Kimiko took her comb out and Dojo started flying. \"Well,\" Dojo began, taking the Wu scroll from his pocket, \"It says here that the River Kunai is supposed to be able to travel long distances as a throwing knife. It can also be used to cling onto when you\"re underwater. It\"ll go forward in any direction you want and you\"ll be able to breathe as long as you hold onto it or someone or something that\"s already holding it.\" \"Pretty cool.\" Raimondo said in awe. \"Oooooohhhhh. It will be moooooooost useful and fun to travel without having to swim!\" Omi squealed. \"So where is it?\" Clay asked as he straightened his hat. \"Tokyo, in the country.\" Dojo answered breezily. \"Home sweet ho-\" Kimiko broke off as she stared at one of the birds flying alongside them. She suddenly felt uneasy. \"Huh?\" Omi and Drew looked at her. \"Eeeerrrrrrr......\" Kimko started to sweat. \"Evil boy genius! Prince of darkness! At your service!\" a voice bragged as a freaky Goth kid came by. He was surrounded by his robots. He was flying alongside Dojo by means of a couple of propellers. \"Jack Spicer! Prepare for a mooooost humiliating defeat!\" Omi yelled. It would be easier to get rid of him right now than have a showdown with him for the Wu later. The monks jumped up, prepared for battle. Kimiko was actually glad to see him. \"JACKBOTS! ATTACK!\" Jack gave the usual command. \"Warriors! Get in formation!\" Omi yelled. \"SHOKU DRAGON FORMATION!!!\" the monks yelled. The monks immediately had their shadows creep up upon them like armor. Jack Spicer\"s jaw dropped. \"HUH!??!?!?!?!\" \"SHOKU WHALE, WATER!\" \"SHOKU LION, FIRE!\" \"SHOKU WOLF, THUNDER!\" \"SHOKU BUZZARD, WIND!\" \"SHOKU BULL, EARTH!\" Omi\"s hands were already swirling with fierce water as he summoned a tsunami out of nowhere. He went for some robots and Jack. Kimiko\"s arms weren\"t even visible under all the swirling flames. She charged, throwing fireballs and blowing fire out of her mouth. Drew was using lightning in her palms again, swiping them like swords. Raimondo brought up a hurricane and charged, blowing wind out of his mouth. Clay used his hands to bring up boulders from the ground so far below. His arms turned to massive stone limbs as he smashed a robot. \"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!\" Spicer was already screaming as Omi pummeled him with water. His propellers broke. Kimiko was just swiping for him when he brought up an extra pair. \"DAMN YOU! MY AUNTIE GAVE ME THOSE FOR VALENTINE\"S DAY!!\" Drew stopped swiping at a crowd of bots to look down at the fleeing freak in surprise. There were people wimpy as that? \"Never mind that Drew!\" Clay yelled, smashing the bots with some boulders. \"I agree!\" Raimondo yelled as he blew the last of the bots away. \"Other evil might want the Shen Gong Wu!\" Kimiko punched the last of the bots as she thought of Hannibal Roy Bean. As the monks scrambled back on Dojo, Kimiko looked over her shoulder again. In the midst of the others chatting over their victory, she couldn\"t help but think that they were being watched... \"The monks have grown well.\" Chase Young commented in his lair. He was watching the monks through a crystal ball. Wuya was, thankfully, in his 5-star bathroom. He didn\"t want her to see this. She was annoying enough as it is. He turned, a slight, familiar smirk crossing his face. It is time...for the seeds of evil grip to the chosen monk...for prophecy to take hold... PT: Alright! Please review! I\"ve got to go now; my dog\"s hopping mad for the bathroom. Is Chase Young behind the evil going on in a monk\"s head? Mmmmmmmmmmaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyyybbbbbbbbbbbbbbeeeeeeee... Again, sorry the stupid fight scene. I\"m bad those. Again, suggestions are welcome! PT: Chappy 4! Yay! Anyway, to Aria Pedrosa, I\"d like to say that I\"m 12 too, in 7th grade. I\"m technically 13, according to my nationality. I guess I don\"t have to worry that much though. My birthday is coming up in August. It brings a lot of stuff. In 2009, I\"ll have to move to a different town. It\"s close to the town I live in now, but I\"m still sad! I\"ve lived in this town for my whole life! I feel jealous of people who have lived in the towns they loved their whole lives and never even plan to move away. I\"ll lose my braces too. The freedom is something I itch for. I\"d like to thank everyone for reviews! Anyway, I hope you enjoy this chapter! \"There it is!\" Raimundo called out, gesturing at field. Dojo had finally taken the monks to the country to Tokyo. He had taken them to a field of cherry blossom trees, or a haruno of sakura, as Kimiko called it. Raimundo gestured again as the other monks whipped their heads around. \"Huh?\" Omi, our cuddly cheeseball, was clearly confused. (Crickets chirping) \"You sure you spotted our Wart?\" Omi and Kimiko turned to look at Clay, who had his mouth open. \"Clay,\" Raimundo said, not turning around, \"You sound like your sister.\" \"That wasn\"t me!\" Clay sputtered, his blond hair lifting so you could see both of his eyes. \"Then who-\" \"It was us!\" a shrill, happy voice cried out. The voice was familiar, veeeeeerrrrrrrrrry familiar... \"Jessie! Megan!\" Omi exclaimed, wide eyed as he gawked at the girls. \"Yo!\" Raimundo waved as he finally turned around, obviously pleased at the sight of the two girls. Drew raised an eyebrow. \"Old friends?\" she inquired of Dojo. \"Yup.\" Dojo replied. \"Well, who\"s this?\" Jessie asked cheerfully, gesturing towards Drew. \"That\"s Drew, for thunder.\" Clay passed out the info breezily, obviously pleased to see his sister without having to tie each other up and attempt to toss each other of a bridge. \"New warrior, huh?\" Jessie asked, looking Drew up and down. \"Uh.\" Drew was obviously freaked out. \"Hi!\" Megan said cheerfully, waving, \"I met this girl with a Shen Gong Wu while I was on vacation here! We both talked a little when I pointed the Wu out and she brought me here, saying she had a tracking device for activated Shen Gong Wu that she stole from my stupid cousin, Jack! So we both figured you knew both of us so I went with Jessie!\" Jessie and Megan were both on Jessie\"s motorcycle, with the Wings of Tanabi attached to the back. \"Hello! Wu anybody?\" a voice called out. \"Huh?\" The monks, Dojo, Jessie and Megan spun around. There, in the sunlight, was a tall, barefoot witch with long, red hair and creepy eye-makeup.Omi was already screaming. \"WUYARETURNTHESHENGONGWUORSUFFERAMOOOOOOOOOOOOOSSTHUMILIATINGDEFEAT!\" (Crickets chirping) \"Ooookaaaaaaaayyyy...\" Kimiko muttered. There was an uncomfortable silence as everyone followed Omi\"s gaze to the object in Wuya\"s hand. It was a silvery-blue kunai knife. \"Oh no you ain\"t!\" Jessie yelled as she tossed her lasso. The loop immediately closed around the kunai. Unfortunately, Clay had let his own trusty lasso out as well. His loop bumped off of Jessie\"s on contact and instead of getting the kunai, he got...Wuya\"s wrist. Wuya grinned evilly and quickly took control of the situation. She gave a flick of her wrists...and sent the blond siblings tumbling toward a large boulder on the ground, to their deaths. \"AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!\" Jessie found herself being jerked out of the motorcycle as the end of the lasso in her hand slipped out of her grasp. She fell, screaming and feeling fluttery in the stomach. Clay screamed even louder as he was pulled off Dojo. He clutched his lasso...finding it to be cut in the middle. The air pressure was too much... \"NNNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!\" Kimiko screamed as she launched herself off Dojo, heading for her friends. \"Shoku lion, fire!\" As she summoned fire, she felt something grabbing her wrist. \"No!\" The fire died down as Wuya tightened her grasp on Kimiko\"s wrist. Raimundo was already in the air, eyes trained on the Japanese warrior... ...As Wuya grabbed him too. \"Well, I\"ve done a nice job today.\" Wuya commented sickeningly, as Omi screamed and went after Clay, Megan right behind him, eyes on Jessie. Drew went for Wuya, eyes determined. Wuya grinned as she tightened her grasp on the struggling Raimundo and Kimiko. \"A Shen Gong Wu...\" Omi and Megan caught the Texan siblings right before they hit the boulder... \"...and two hostages...\" With that, she disappeared just as Drew released a punch...into thin air. \"No!\" Omi screamed. Clay had seen the whole thing. As soon as he got back on Dojo, he took the Fist of Tebigong from his pocket and punched himself. Jessie and Megan just sniffed as Jessie settled down in her motorcycle. Dojo started sobbing...no...bawling. As for Drew, the kid just tipped back her head and howled... All around the world, people suddenly felt jabs in their hearts for no reason at all. Soon, there wasn\"t a dry eye in the heavens or hell. PT: Hope this fight scene was okay. Thanks for all the reviews! I\"ve got a new stream of ideas coming so...yeah... Anyway, no problem. I won\"t make Drew a Mary Sue. Never intended to but I could have made her one accidentally.) Anyway, thanks for reading and reviewing! PT: Hi everybody! ;) I hope you like this chapter! I am hoping to be able to start a pairing in this chapter. You may already know what the pairing is...or not... Anyways, enjoy and please review! Kimiko crawled over to Raimundo. Wuya had taken them to a giant birdcage about as tall as Jack Spicer\"s house, with a diameter of 10 feet. She had left them with their hands tied behind their backs before she left, sniggering. Kimiko and Raimundo could see outside the cage, but there wasn\"t much to see. They were in a grassy field. All they could see was grass, in every direction. Kimiko doubted that they could get away easily. Wuya would definitely be watching and in this field, it won\"t be hard to catch the monks. The only thing they could do was untie themselves. Kimiko nudged Raimundo. \"Wake up!\" she whispered fiercely. She wasn\"t going to sound desperate in front of him. It might give away how worried she was about him. The Brazilian teen opened his eyes. They stared at Kimiko a moment before closing them again. \"Don\"t.\" he moaned wearily. \"Raimundo!\" Raimundo\"s eyes snapped open. His olive green eyes stared at the Japanese warrior. Huh. Now that I think of it, I never really told her how nice her eyes are. I\"ve never seen a more brilliant blue color. \"Raimundo!\" Kimiko snapped, \"Stay awake and help me think of how to escape!\" She\"s cute when she\"s angry. \"How do we get out of here?\" Raimundo asked, deciding to go along. It\"s not like he could go to sleep again. Kimiko would keep prodding him and even resort to beating him up if he won\"t heed her. Raimundo cringed at the thought. Well, if she does, we\"ll be touching each other at the very least. He shook his head. Huh? He had really just thought that? He was so distracted by his thoughts that he didn\"t notice when Kimiko slapped him. \"Earth to Raimudo!\" \"Whuh?\" Kimiko glared at the Xiaolin leader. \"You are our leader! We need to escape to help the others! Who knows what\"ll happen to the other monks if we aren\"t there? Master Fung always taught us about teamwork!\" Raimundo nodded, a numb feeling in his chest. \"Right.\" Teamwork. It seemed to Raimundo that that was what stood in the way of having a relationship with Kimiko. He always cared for his friends. It felt wrong to have feelings for one of them. That would mean he favored one. Raimundo stood up, the numb feeling still in his chest. \"What do you have in mind?\" he asked. Kimiko stared at him for a long time. The only sound was the wind blowing through the grass. Finally, Raimundo broke the silence. \"You were the one worried about escaping!\" he accused, \"Answer me!\" That seemed to do the trick. Kimiko snapped out of whatever had kept her silent and staring. \"Oh! Right.\" She seemed embarrassed. Hey, did she just turn red? \"Alright, here\"s the plan. It\"s what I can think of at the moment. You probably won\"t like it, but here\"s a plan I\"ll suggest for now.\" Kimiko leaned forward. \"You\"ll never believe this, but...\" PT: Yeah, hope this was good. It\"s short, but I\"m slightly busy now. My mom\"s making me decide when to go to Paris. Yay! Paris! Anyway, that nagging is kind of annoying and I hate my mom. Sorry, did I say mom? I mean disowned mom. Forget it. As soon as I turn 18, I\"m not having her in my life again. I wish I could actually disown now. For now, I\"m not speaking to her. Anyway, I need to double check my homework. I\"m in a bit of a cranky mood now. I\"m sorry! ;( Dear everyone, There\"s not much time. I can\"t go on the internet anymore. If I come back, I\"ll private message to you if you want. Tell me in a review. My mom\"s so annoying! Till then, PT PT: OMG, I have no excuse myself for avoiding this fic for sooooo long :( On a brighter side, I\"m updating this again but it\"s going to be kind of slow. Good news though: I\"m almost done with my Naruto Christmas fic, so as soon as I finish that, I can update quickly again! :) Anyway, yeah, I do have problems with my mom. I\"ve hit that age. Anyway, here we go! Note: Drew is not a Mary Sue, but she will be very significant. She will have many Mary Sue properties, but only for future comic relief. Please bear with me, people! The Omi, Clay and Drew sat around impatiently in the Sheng Gong Wu\"s Temple, figdeting slightly as Master Fung meditated. Dojo was trembling in Clay\"s hat, apparently in shock. Clay was rubbing his bruise, as if in infinite pain. Technically, the bruise did hurt, but not that much; the cowboy was used to pain by now, having experienced far more before, countless times over. His face was, indeed, a nasty black, but Master Fung had told him he was lucky he didn\"t bleed. Clay doubted this, but, for the sake of keeping a level head, agreed with it -- barely, but he did. Omi was meditating...upside down. The cheeseball kid had his eyes clenched shut with concentration, eyebrows furrowed. Yet, the boy was twitching every five seconds or so; he could not keep his mind on saving his friends like this. Drew\"s head was down, so no one could see her face. She did not cry, but just sat, eyes fixed on the floor, as if the smooth surface had caught her greatest interest. Master Fung sat there calmly, a look of serenity over his pale face, passing over his closed eyelids. Omi suddenly clenched his fist. He trembled violently, harding than before as something passed over his mind. These images that sudddenly came to his head, he had never seen such places before... Omi saw himself, in his mind\"s eye: he was at a black temple, smooth and magnificent with trimmings of gold and red along its edges... Another flash and the monk saw himself attacking some unknown victims, eyes wicked as he stood on a pillar of water, in the middle of some place on fire. Ashes burned, sparks flew as Omi stood there, casting a great shadow, twisting the fire with his bare hands but never getting burnt and, incredibly, his fists seemed to be made of stone. The image changed again in a flash of black and Omi suddenly found himself listening to screams. Those screams, tortured, hurt, blood-curdling, chilled the monk to the bone. He heard laughter in the darkness, chilling, sick, twisted, sadistic laughter, basking in the glory of the screams. Without another warning, Omi\"s vision faded completely to black. \"The Buttercup?\" Raimundo stared at Kimiko incredulously. Was she kidding? No, this was a life and death situation; she couldn\"t actually be kidding. Still, this was Kimiko. Of all people, she knew how to memorize this trick? She must be on Youtube a lot these days, Raimundo thought dully. Still, he had to admit, it was clever. After all, why would Wuya go on Youtube and watch comedies? She wouldn\"t suspect a thing. However, there was a problem... \"We\"re missing a cup,\" Raimundo said. \"We need that for the Buttercup.\" He was corrected a split second later, for Kimiko looked his straight in the eye and said, bluntly, \"I have one.\" (Crickets chirping.) Raimundo took a deep breath as he stared at the Japanese girl\"s blue eyes (They really are kind of...okay-looking). \"Then, let\"s do it.\" -Severely bangs head on table- PT: Holy crap, I\"m so sorry for this short chapter, this badly written chapter and horribly late chapter. -Bangs head again- Sooooo sorry, but you might know what I mean by the Buttercup if you watch a lot of Youtube. I might make the next chapter longer. I\"ll update soon as I could. Thanks for the reviews and hoping to get more!! 00\" I\"m hopeless."]}

But his voice sounded familiar.\" \"Do you know who he sounded like?\" Trivette asked \"No, but I know I had heard his voice before.\" \"Can you tell me what he said?\" Trivette asked getting a nod from Melissa. \"He said \"be quiet or I will kill you\" he then pulled out a gun, Angie said, \"why are you doing this\" Angie got up and tried to fight him but she hit her foot on the bed and said \"ouch\". And he grabbed her arm and told her to put on some shoes, the light went on in the closet and I heard Angie put on her shoes and then...\" Melissa trailed off. Trivette looked at Melissa and realized, by the fear in her eyes, that she was reliving the nightmare of seeing the kidnapping take place. \"And then her lead her out of the room.\" Melissa said, with her head down, as she started to cry a little bit; but like her father and sisters, she soon regained her composure and looked up showing no fear. \"Alright, honey. I think you said enough right now, so why don\"t we take a break then we will try again on the description later.

If you make a sound, I\"ll cut your throat, and if you don\"t do as you\"re told your family will die, and it will be all your fault. Do you understand?\" the man said as he traded the handgun for a large sharp knife, which he now held to Angela\"s throat. \"Now move it!\" shouted the man as he pushed Angela across the yard \"Why are you doing this?\" Angela pleaded for answers as the man dragged her by the arm toward a small river that ran at the edge of the ranch. \"I have been waiting my whole life for a girl like you.\" The man said in a passionate tone. \"Who are you?\" \"Did I forget my manners? I\"m Tim Ross, and you are now my Anastasia.\" Tim said in a low taunting tone. Angela suddenly realized who the man was; he had been the one to talk to her and Melissa after their concert. When the reached the river Angela saw a black duffle bag sitting on the bank \"You are one fine looking lady. Now take off the nightgown.\" Tim said as he kissed Angela\"s neck. Angela reluctantly did as she was told, she knew what Tim was going to do, but somehow she felt detached from her body, at the time she would do anything to protect her family. Tim then tied her hands together and then he pinned her to the ground and raped her. After he was finished Tim grabbed the duffle bag and out of it the pulled out of it a skimpy outfit. \"Put this on.\" Tim ordered. Angela put it on grateful to have something covering her. Tim then led Angela to a road that was about a mile away. A dark van sat there waiting on them after Angela was put in the van she felt a needle go into her arm before she passed out. When Angela woke up, she felt helpless and terrified, her head pounded as if a thousand drums were pounding in her ears. Quickly taking in the surroundings, Angela realizes that she is in a dark windowless room, light enters the room when the door opens, she realizes that the room in about five feet long and about four feet wide. A blanket and small pillow are the only things she can see in the room. Trying to move Angela discovers that her hands are tied together. \"How do you like it?\" Tim asked. \"I hope it meets your expectations because you\"ll be spending the rest of your life here. I forgot to go over the rules so I thought I should do it now: you do as I tell you to do. If you don\"t, not only will you be beaten, but, your family will suffer the price. I have people watching them at all times; if you slip up, I will have them killed. Get that in your head right now, you mess up, your family dies.\" After Tim finished, he closed the door plunging the room into total darkness... TBC (Thanks for the reviews) Three days later... When Walker and Alex got to the police station they were each taken to separate interrogation rooms, Walker was interviewed by Detective Tom Mason; and Alex was interviewed by Larry Eller. Both Walker and Alex were anxious to get their interviews over and done with so the investigation could really start looking for Angela. Melissa had been interviewed for two hours the day after Angela was abducted; however, the Dallas police were not putting much emphasis on her testimony because of her age saying that it was a vague description. Trivette, however, was able to get a clear description of the events that happened that night from Melissa. Interrogation room 1 -Alex Detective Eller and Alex were sitting at a large table facing each other \"Mrs. Walker, where were you the night Angela was abducted?\" \"At home in bed, we got home late and after putting Christina in bed in her and Melissa\"s room I went to sleep in the master bedroom.\" \"Why were you home late?\" \"Angela and Melissa had a music recital, it was over by ten and it was about ten-thirty by time we got home.\" \"Do you know what Angela wore to bed that night?\" \"No, last time I saw her she was still in the dress she wore to the recital.\" \"What did that dress look like?\" \"It was a green, floor-length dress.\" Interrogation room 2 -Walker In the next interrogation room, Walker was being asked the same questions as Alex. \"Ranger Walker, where were you the night Angela was abducted?\" \"At home,\" \"When did you notice your daughter was missing?\" \"When Melissa came into our room, saying that Angela was gone.\" \"You didn\"t hear anything before that?\" \"No,\" \"Do you know what Angela wore to bed that night?\" \"Yeah, she had on a white sleeveless nightgown with purple flowers on it.\" After the interrogation, Walker and Alex were met by Sheriff Henson and Trivette. After speaking to Walker and Alex, the Sheriff and Trivette stepped out of earshot of Alex and Walker. \"Ranger Trivette, during the search of the ranch one of the dogs came across a young girl\"s nightgown that matches Walker\"s description of the one Angela was wearing the night she was abducted.\" The Sheriff reported. \"It\"s been bagged and I was hoping you would be able to identify them if it was Angela\"s.\" Trivette agreed to see the nightgown to tell if he could identify the clothing is Angela\"s, the sheriff leads Trivette to a small room where the clothing is laid out on the table Trivette immediately recognizes the nightgown as one that Angela had often worn when she stayed at his house every so often. \"We\"re sending it out now to be checked for prints.\" The sheriff reported as they walked out of the room; both men knew that the discovery of Angela\"s nightgown meant that Angela had probably been sexually assaulted there or somewhere close by. Trivette looked over at Walker and Alex with a look of sympathy hating the fact that he was going to have to tell them. Walker had taken Alex into his arms and was just holding her, comforting her, as Alex cried on his shoulder. Alex tore away from Walker and ran towards the two men when she saw them come out of the room. \"What did they find?\" She asked. He shook his head. \"They found her nightgown; it looks like she was sexually assaulted.\" \"Oh my God, no!\" Alex screamed and sobbed on Walker\"s shoulder. \"Walker, we need to get her out of here.\" Trivette said quietly. \"And you too.\" He lightly touched his partner\"s arm. Walker stiffened at the touch, but nodded in response. Walker ranch Erica had just hung up the phone after talking to her husband. Trivette had called and said what they had found and that Walker and Alex should be home soon. Erica had volunteered to watch Mel and Chris while Walker and Alex had their interviews, since Simon and Andrew was at the hope center, with Michael, Hannah and Amanda and Syd had her hands full with work. But after three hours with the girls she really began to wonder why... ...Melissa had not said a word to anyone since she finished her interviews with the police, two days ago, (she was no closer to remembering whose voice the man sounded like); in fact, all Mel would do is keep playing a portion of a song on her harp over and over again. Walker had told Erica that the song had been one that Angela had been teaching her, and the spot were Mel would stop was all that she had learned. She would then play it again, as if expecting Angela to magically appear and teach her the rest... ...Chris would keep asking where Angela was about every two minutes. She had also taken a small pillow from Angela\"s bed and carries it everywhere she can, and if anyone tried to take it away from her, then the fists would fly. Everyone had quickly given up fighting with her. Even though she was only four, she, like her sisters, proved to be Walker\"s daughters at a very early age... Erica turned on the TV, and saw a picture of Angela playing her harp as CNN was running a report on Angela\"s abduction, \"... Eleven year old Angela Walker was abducted from her home in Dallas early on morning of December 2, around two a.m., Dallas police, the Texas Rangers and the FBI have obtained evidence that they are not releasing to the press at this time. If you have any information on the whereabouts of Angela Walker please contact the Dallas Sheriff\"s office, the Texas Rangers, or call the Angela Walker search center at... 1-800-976-3250...\" Angela\"s abduction had soon made national headlines and national press soon set up camp outside ranger headquarters and the search center set up at the hope center, trying to find out the evidence in the case. The press had only been given the information necessary, because it would ensure Melissa\"s privacy and safety; due to the fact that the kidnapper would then know there was a witness. When Walker and Alex arrived home, Erica could see the pain in their eyes and knew Trivette had told them about what they had found. Alex stared out the window while absently playing with her necklace, the cross that matched the ones the girls wore, as she tried not to think about what happened to her daughter the night she was kidnapped... TBC Christmas wish -December 16, Four-year-old Christina sat in the living room when the doorbell rang, going to the door as Alex opened it. \"Grandpa!\" The four year old cried, as she gave a big hug to Alex\"s dad who stood in the doorway. \"Hey there\"s my little princess.\" Gordon said as he picked her up and swung her in the air. \"Dad, what are you doing here I thought all the airports in New York were snowed in?\" Alex asked as she gave Gordon a hug. \"They were, but I would have made it here if I had to walk to Dallas. How are you and Walker holding up?\" Gordon asked with a face full of concern, but after seeing her tearstained cheeks he knew the answer. Setting Christina on the floor, Gordon told her to go play while he and Alex had some adult time. Christina ran up the stairs to her room. Hearing Melissa on her harp Gordon knew there was no change in her since he had talked to Alex on the phone two weeks ago. \"Melissa is still playing that song?\" \"Yeah, and she won\"t talk or listen to anyone. When anyone tries to talk to her, she will either ignore them completely, or run away. The girls take after Walker way to much, they\"re both not allowing any emotion to show at all...\"Alex said as her voice trailed off, fighting the tears that started to from in her eyes. Gordon just shook his head, as he went into the living room where Melissa sat playing her harp. When she stopped she would look over at Angela\"s harp that stood beside her, she would then play the same song again. \"Hey Sweetheart, are you going to make me wait forever to get a hug?\" Gordon asked, Melissa stopped playing and looked up at him. Getting up from her harp, she walked over slowly, almost like she was afraid of him, and gave Gordon a hug. Then Melissa, pulled back, she now tried to keep everyone at least three feet away from her. Later that evening Gordon sat outside on the porch with Christina. \"Grandpa, you want to know my Christmas wish?\" Christina asked, \"Sure baby, what is it?\" \"I wish that Angela would be home on Christmas, and that, the bad person didn\"t hurt her.\" Christina said as she looked at her grandfather with child-like innocence shinning from her eyes, but behind that Gordon could see strength and wisdom that exceeded her four-years. Gordon could feel the tears coming to his eyes, as he pulled his youngest granddaughter closer he whispered, \"Me too, Baby. Me too.\" After she fell asleep Gordon carried her up to her and Melissa\"s purple andwhite bedroom. After he tucked her in, he said a prayer asking that her Christmas wish does come true. TBC (A/N: Thanks for the reviews) Not close enough Well I can\"t ever really believe No one was sent to get me And I feel like I\"m being erased No one got left here I\"m all alone No one was sent to get me I\"m all alone No one got left here Tim entered the room where Angela was, as he tried to pin Angela down; Angela, knowing that she would have to save herself, was able to kick him in the head, Tim fell to the floor stunned. Angela took the chance and tried to run, she ran up the stairs and out the front door, as it started to rain. But I\"m fine No one got left here Well I\"m fine No one got left here Even though the thunder and lighting, wind and the rain was brutal and her feet kept slipping in the mud, she didn\"t care she just continued running. I can\"t breathe when I see the pictures sent without you I feel like I\"ve been erased No one got left here By time she reached the road her head was pounding from the drugs. She saw a state trooper\"s squad car pull away from a traffic stop. \"Wait! Stop!\" Angela yelled, as she ran, to get the officer\"s attention. Seeing that she hadn\"t succeeded she screamed, \"SOMEBODY HELP ME!\" I\"m all alone No one was sent to get me I\"m all alone No one got left here That was the last thing Angela remembered before she felt a knife being pressed against her throat and the world around her going black... TBC (A/N: words in italics are Angela\"s thoughts.) Angela\"s body ached all over from the drugs still in her system, Tim kept her sedated most of the time to prevent her from fighting him, as she started to slowly come out of her unconscious-like state. Panic once again raced through her veins as she tried to pull her tightly bound wrists free. She blinked several times to focus her blurry eyes and realized that not only her hands were tied but a chain was around her neck to keep her from moving, a piece of duct tape was also across her mouth. \"Welcome back Anastasia,\" Tim said in a low taunting tone. \"Did you have a good sleep?\" Angela just mumbled angrily as she continued to work herself into a useless sweat over her vain attempts at escape. \"We can talk later okay?\" Tim laughed. \"I\"m taking you home Anastasia,\" he said firmly. \"Where you belong.\" \"Home?' Angela\"s mind raced in terror, as beads of fearful sweat started to gently seep down from her forehead. \"This can\"t be happening,' she told herself as she struggled to get free. \"He can\"t...not again...' \"Just calm down and try to relax okay?\" Tim said softly. \"You won\"t be free again for some time and I don\"t want you to hurt yourself too much. Plus you will probably be gagged most of the time so get used to shallow breathing.\" Angela; however, didn\"t listen or care about what he was saying as she just kept straining her muscles to get free of her tight bonds. After a few more minutes Angela finally realized she wasn\"t going anywhere and, deciding to save her strength for later, just slumped back on the seat in anger. She closed her eyes and said a prayer begging for the strength and courage to somehow put and end to this living hell. \"You\"re awfully quiet Anastasia,\" Tim mocked as he slowly drove towards their destination. \"I mean I like you silent as well, but, would you at least moan for me a bit? That sound is such...well it is such a turn on...\" Angela heard his sickening words, followed by his evil laughter and tried even harder to think on something else. Sadly her panicked brain wouldn\"t allow anything but fear to be dwelt on. Knowing she couldn\"t give in, decided to keep trying to pull her free of the ropes, telling herself she couldn\"t give in to her fear. If she did, she was as good as dead. \"No?\" Tim asked in mock sadness. \"Very well then.\" Angela lay on her back and looked up at Tim with a hateful look. Tim met her gaze and continued to stare at her helpless form with a dark hungry stare, making Angela feel an evil shiver cover her entire sweat and rain covered body. \"What will he do to me now?' Angela wondered as she continued to try to loosen her hands. She had already cut into her skin with the tight ropes but at this point she just didn\"t care. Freedom and survival were the only thoughts in her mind. That and her family... \"My family...' Angela\"s mind raced in terror \"will they be killed now because I chose to run?' At that moment in her mind, Angela saw her family; the thought of them being killed because of her was more than she could bear. \"But what if I\"m not found in time?' She wondered in dread. \"What will I have to endure?' she tried to brush the thought aside for she already knew the pain and horror Tim had in mind for her; Because she had already experienced it once before. \"He can\"t rape me again, he will probably kill my family now, and it\"s all because of me\" Angela thought in anguish as she felt her eyes start to water. She tried to choke them back but as her mind replayed the whole horrible rape scene and the thought of her family being killed, Angela felt her chest constrict and her lungs tighten. Panic started to grip her throat and with the duct tape and the chain, breathing in through her nose was painful and labored. She started to yell into the piece of duct tape as a mild panic attack started. \"Now, now Anastasia,\" Tim said in a mock soothing tone. \"Just try to relax okay; or I think you know what you\"ll have to endure when we get home.\" Angela heard the words, which only made her panic even more. She felt bile come up into her mouth but with the duct tape she had no other choice but to swallow it. Angela shook her head no but knew no matter what she did or said Tim would not listen. She knew Tim had obviously convinced himself that she was willing in some way that to try to talk him out of it would be doubtful. \"But I just can\"t give in;' Angela\"s panicked mind told her. \"Help me! Someone please help me,' her mind started to call out once more. \"God please help me.' When they arrived to the place Tim called home, Tim carried Angela downstairs. After Angela\"s hands were tied to a post, Tim picked up a stick of wood saying \"I\"ll teach you a lesson for running away.\" He then hit Angela on her back; Tim was surprised that Angela didn\"t make one sound throughout the entire ordeal. Soon Angela passed out from the pain in her back. Angela opened her eyes and looked around the room that had become her prison cell. Slowly she sat up trying to ignore the pounding in her head and the pain in her back and legs that soon caused her to fall back to the floor. After the room quit spinning Angela was able to stand up without falling to the floor. Her back felt like it was on fire, but she had learned from her father how to put the pain out of her mind. Bringing her knees up to her chest as she sat on the floor, she heard a voice that sounded familiar. After listening she realized; she could hear a Texas news program. \"In Dallas today, a bomb went of in the Texas Ranger\"s Headquarters\" building. We are confirming the reports of fatalities; it is confirmed that Texas Ranger Cordell Walker was killed in the bombing. We will bring you more information as it becomes available.\" As the news report finished, Angela felt the tears coming on. She knew that the bombing was her fault and that her father was dead because of her. Moving over to the corner, Angela curled into the fetal position sobbing. Tim on the other side of the door, smiled to himself, knowing his ploy had worked. Turning off the CD that contained the pieced together news report, in reality there had never been a bombing just a lot of old news broadcasts that had been edited together. He knew Angela wouldn\"t try to run away again. Going up the stairs he turned off the light and shut the door... TBC The missing piece -January 14, \"Melissa Nicole, have you feed Gunner yet?\" Alex asked as she walked into the living room where Melissa and Christina were watching a movie with Gordon, who was staying with them until he could fly back to New York. The night Gordon arrived in Dallas; he had told them about how because of the snow, holiday travel, and flying on short notice, he had to make a roundabout trip, but he had managed to get on the last flight to Washington DC and from there flew to Indianapolis were he had a lay over until the next morning, Gordon then flew to Oklahoma City, and then to Houston, and from there finally able to fly to Dallas.", "Connor came home one night with a hickey on his neck and a smug look on his face as he washed for bed. Murphy\"s ire was such that he burned to physically remove that look from his brother\"s face. His anger frightened him. Connor was only doing what any other red-blooded teenage male was, why did it make a difference? A tiny voice inside answered him coldly. He\"s forgotten about you. A wave of nausea so severe had completely overtaken him at the thought. He ran past his bewildered twin, and sank pitifully to his knees on the floor as the contents of his stomach forced itself up. Connor was at his back in an instant, his voice frantic. Murphy couldn\"t hear what he was saying over the roar of pain in his ears, over the echoes of his retching. He felt Connor\"s touch like a burn on his back and he shivered in agony. Satisfied he was done vomiting, Murphy rose quickly and sharply. He flushed the toilet, washed his face and brushed his teeth. Connor\"s voice was like a distant whine, the pain hadn\"t stopped yelling in his ears. When he was done he looked at Connor through the mirror in front of him. His face was twisted in beautiful concern, but Murphy\"s eyes slid to the hickey on his neck. Connor gasped sharply and covered it with his hand, but it was too late. He knew it had been seen. Murphy forced a rueful smile and raised an eyebrow. \"Had fun didja?\" He kept his tone light, praying fervently on the inside that his brother would take the quip at face value. Murphy watched Connor consider for a moment, then roll his eyes and drop his hand. \"Aye, that I did.\" \"Ya better wear a turtle neck tamorrow, Ma\"ll have yer head on a spit.\" Connor snorted, and then cast a pointed look at his brother. \"Are ya alright, Murph?\" Murphy looked convincingly confused for a moment before answering. \"Oh! Aye. Uncle Sibeal and his fucken shepherd\"s pie. I haven\"t the foggiest where he got the idea ta be a culinary master. I wouldn\"t ha\" fed it ta tha cats.\" Connor laughed and clapped his brothers back in sympathy. \"Well, then. Glad I missed it.\" They both slid into their respective beds, casting each other wary smiles before they turned the lights off. Murphy, exhausted from the retching fell straight to sleep. Connor lay awake for hours. He\"d allowed his brother\"s joking to placate him, but Murphy\"s eyes never lie and they hadn\"t been laughing. Connor, to Murphy\"s shock, kept dating Kaitlin through the next couple of months. If he saw his brother, it was usually with the red-head at his side, beaming happily or giggling, blushing. Connor would spot him, call him over and Murphy had to steel himself and plaster a smile. Connor\"s arm thrown around his neck was agonizing bliss. He could never form more than two words when Kaitlin was around. Murphy supposed that\"s why Kaitlin always eyed him a bit funny but he couldn\"t care less what the tart thought of him. Connor would rib him, calling him shy. Playing along he looked down at his feet, mumbling. Murphy started talking less and less at school, throwing himself into his studies and he made a point of not being home afterwards. His Ma might not be educated, but she was sharp and she would pry, knowing there was something wrong. Murphy couldn\"t handle someone else\"s prying. It got colder and colder outside, making it difficult for Murphy to wander and draw. He started perusing the local library\"s art section. Murphy took great solace there, and he knew no one would go looking for him at the library. He would drown in the huge colorful pages...he decided he liked impressionism the best. It was bright, beautiful and undefined. It was the way he and Connor used to be. Murphy whistled idly as he made his way home. He could never be forlorn around Christmas time, the decorations and pretty lights twinkled merrily and they rubbed off on him. Murphy tromped up the stairs, grunting at the heaviness of his books. He promptly dropped them all when he saw Connor sitting on his bed. \"Connor! AH! Fuck!\" Murphy cursed as one of his heavier books landed on his foot. He heard Connor laugh and stride over to help. \"Easy there Murph, no broken toes...\" When they managed to dump all the books on his desk, Murphy turned to look at his brother. \"Where\"s Kaitlin?\" Connor shrugged. \"Ah, Christmas shopping with her mum. Couldn\"t stand ta be dragged along, don\"t know if I\"ll hear tha end of it...but I missed ya.\" Murphy smiled brightly. \"Aye well, it\"s good ta see ya, thought I was hallucinatin\" fer-\" He stopped short when he noticed his sketchbook lying open on Connor\"s bed. Murphy\"s heart clenched painfully. \"What is THAT doin\" there?!\" Connor had the decency to look horribly embarrassed. \"Well, I saw it lyin\" around and-\" Murphy was reeling. \"No, ya DIDN\"T see it lyin\" around. I NEVER leave it lyin\" around.\" Connor put his hands up in a conciliatory gesture, face red and openly pleading for Murphy to calm down. \"Murph, relax, alright? I saw tha corner sticken outta tha edge o\" your desk drawer...I was wrong ta snoop, m\"really sorry.\" Murphy debated hitting Connor, but thought better of it. He hadn\"t seen his brother in what felt like an age. If he decked Connor he might not see him again for two. He satisfied himself with grabbing the sketchbook and shoving it angrily back in its place. \"Aye, well, ya should be.\" Connor sank back to his bed and when Murphy turned around his brother was fixing him with a gaze that tore the breath from his lungs. He made himself busy shuffling school papers. \"Murph.\" Murphy took a deep breath and forced himself to look at his brother. Connor had a small smile on his face, and he shook his head in amazement. \"Murphy, I had no idea...those drawings... you are so fucken talented.\" Murphy favored his brother a grateful if grudging smile. \"Christ, tha drawing of our sliding hill...it\"s so fucken GOOD Murph, I recognized it straight away. How long have ya been drawin\"?\" He went beet red. That was his favorite drawing. Murphy didn\"t know how Connor managed to hone right in on him like that. He half suspected his brother did it without meaning to, but that didn\"t make it any easier on him. \"Well, since around when you an Katie started running tagether. I was wanderin\" around one day, I had extra paper and a pencil in me bag. Tha mood just struck. I really don\"t know why I did it.\" Connor nodded, looking down at his lap and debating whether or not Murphy would fly off the handle if he asked him another question. \"Ma says yer gone a lot. Where d\"ya go?\" Murphy bristled visibly. \"Checkin\" up on me are ya? Because I don\"t ask where you an Katie get off ta.\" Connor frowned. \"Well, I assumed ya wouldn\"t want ta know.\" Murphy shot a heated look of daggers at his brother. \"Likewise.\" Connors head sank into his hands, defeated. Shaking his head he stretched out on his bed, not looking at Murphy. \"Is there any way I can just walk back in here again, an we could start tha conversation over?\" Connor\"s pained whisper made Murphy cringe. He told himself he wasn\"t going to fight with his brother. He was almost positive Connor would rather have been decked than talked to like that, and the thought made him a little ill. \"Fuck.\" He moved to sit beside Connor on the bed. He laid a hand on his brothers back and felt his heart bleed when Connor gasped at the touch. \"Connor, I\"m sorry.\" His brother shuddered. \"Myself as well.\" They stayed that way until Murphy could bear the burning in his hand no longer. He got up and flopped onto his bed, suddenly exhausted. \"Tha library.\" Connor lifted his head onto his arms and looked quizzically at his brother. \"Wha?\" Murphy rolled onto his side, propping himself up with one arm. \"Ya asked where I get off ta when m\"not home.\" Connor mimicked his brothers action, quizzical look still on his face. \"Whaddya go there fer?\" Murphy blushed, fiddling with his blanket. Connor closed his eyes wanting to burn the way his brother looked right then into his brain. \"Well, I\"ve gotten ta really like drawin\". I figured I should look at artwork, pictures an paintins and tha like... one o\" my teacher\"s said I should... if I wanted ta improve, ya know?\" Connor smiled. \"Well Murph, I think ya\"ve already got the one-up on just about everyone in tha county.\" Murphy smiled brightly at his brother\"s praise, he really couldn\"t help it. No one else\"s opinion mattered to him. Connor sat up abruptly, a thought occurring. \"Hey, I think I have just tha thing...\" Murphy just watched in curiosity as his brother rifled through his own desk, cursing. Connor gave a little shout of delight when he found what he was looking for. \"Here ya go.\" He handed Murphy a large piece of corkboard and a box of tacks with a flourish and a shy grin. Murphy just looked up at his brother confused. Connor shuffled his feet a bit. \"Ah, Aunt Mary gave it ta me last year when she was cleanin\" out her closets. I never had tha use fer it. You should hang yer sketches up. They\"re really good.\" Murphy swallowed the lump of gratitude growing in his throat. It was a fucken corkboard, and it was the most thoughtful thing Connor had ever given him. He smiled brilliantly. \"Thanks Connor. I\"ll hang it up tanight.\" Connor grinned and ruffled Murphy\"s hair. \"M\"glad ya like it.\" They both jumped in unison at the loud grating shout that boomed upstairs from the kitchen. \"I\"ll not be waitin\" another minute fer you ungrateful heathens ta get down here for dinner!!\" Murphy pulled a serious face and looked over his brother\"s shoulder. \"Connor, wha\"s tha?\" He fell for it, as he always did. Connor cursed Murphy\"s wickedness but he was smiling as he flew down the stairs after his laughing brother. It had started earlier that day, and from what he\"d heard on the radio, it was likely to continue late into the night. Murphy tapped his pencil absently on his open book, unfinished homework abandoned by his attention for the ethereal snowfall outside. Murphy looked down at his assignment, due the next day. He grinned. Fuck it. Murphy slammed his books shut, shoved them haphazardly into his bag and took off like a shot past the bewildered librarian and out the main door. He wanted to roll in the snow as soon as he felt it crunch beneath his feet, but logic caught up, reminding him about things like pneumonia and frostbite. He contented himself with catching flakes on his tongue, humming Jingle Bells and jogging home. Murphy knew his Ma was at Aunt Mary\"s helping decorate for her Christmas party and would probably spend the night. He and Connor would be on their own for dinner, but he wasn\"t too hungry yet. He could only think of the snow outside. Murphy passed their hill on the way home, it looked perfect for sliding. Murphy took the stairs two at a time and burst into the bedroom. He wasted no time and rifled through his dresser for the essentials- long johns, socks, hat, gloves, scarf. He was just lacing up his boots when Connor came in. \"Hey Connor!\" Murphy leapt up and grabbed his brother in a fierce hug. \"AH! Christ, Murph, can\"t breathe!\" Murphy let his brother go and hopped about the room with glee, not noticing the uncomfortable look on Connor\"s face. \"Ah, Connor! Didja get a chance ta go outside yet? Tha hill is perfect, we should go before those O\"Reilly brats muss up tha snow!\" Connor had started to undress and change, but it wasn\"t into long johns. \"Murphy, I can\"t go.\" Murphy halted abruptly and looked at his brother in confusion. \"Whaddya mean, ya can\"t? Why tha hell are ya wearin\" a tie?\" Connor sighed, running a hand through his hair nervously. \"Katie\"s havin\" a party at her house, I promised ta be there. You\"re invited too, if ya want ta go and I promise we\"ll go slidin\" tamorrow.\" Murphy sank to his bed, legs refusing to hold him up. He thought he was going to be sick. He couldn\"t look at Connor. \"Connor, why can\"t ya tell Katie ya\"ve got the flu or somethin\"? She\"d believe ya, and wouldn\"t hold it against ya. Come slidin\" with me.\" Connor shook his head, pinching the bridge of his nose. \"Murph, I PROMISED her.\" Murphy lost it and leapt wildly to his feet, invading Connor\"s space. \"What about ME?! I NEVER fucken see ya!! Is it too much ta fucken ask?!\" Connor\"s face contorted in hurt and anger. \"FUCK you Murphy!! We\"re not little fucken kids anymore, why cantcha fucken ACT like it?! I\"m goin\" ta tha party, whether you come with me or not!\" The anger sung through Murphy like a searing lance and before he knew it he was on Connor, his fist connecting soundly with his brother\"s jaw. They were a tornado of violent rage, fists and cursing. The anger turned them animal against one another and they both vied desperately for triumph. Finally Connor won out, slamming his brother hard against the wall. The both of them had bloody mouths, Connor a purpling jaw and Murphy a bleeding nose. They breathed heavily against one another and Connor suddenly felt violently ill. He let go of Murphy who promptly sank to the floor in a battered heap. Connor cleaned his face and changed his shirt. Before he left for the party he threw a wet rag at Murphy. The words were like acid in his mouth. \"Ya better clean yerself up before Ma gets home, wouldn\"t want ya ta get two beatins in one night.\" Murphy\"s rage returned like a re-opened wound. He leapt up and yelled hoarsely at Connor\"s retreating form. \"FUCK you!! I hope ya fucken CHOKE on tha egg-nog!\" The door slammed shut in reply. Murphy seethed and trudged angrily through the snow, wiping frozen tears from his eyes as he made his way to their hill. He felt like he was breaking apart inside. He knew Connor didn\"t hate him, so it was very difficult for him to see why his brother insisted on acting like such a fucken prick. Sure, they were getting older... but to Murphy, sliding with Connor at the first snow was just as important as putting up the Christmas tree every year. It wasn\"t really winter if they hadn\"t done it proper. Why didn\"t Connor see that? When he reached the hill Murphy just stared at its pristine beauty. He felt empty and tired, but he had walked all the way there so he jumped on his tube and slid down, a lone dark figure making tracks in the snow. Over and over he went, sliding down and marching up until Murphy could no longer feel his fingers or toes. Satisfied he had done enough sliding for the both of them Murphy decided to head back home. Halfway back up the hill he noticed someone standing at the top and when he got closer he realized it was Connor. Murphy had been prepared to say something particularly nasty but instead gasped when he got a good look at his brother. Connor looked like he\"d been run over by a truck. \"Jaysus, Connor! What tha fuck happened?\" Connor\"s shirt was all torn and he had a cut over his eye that bled profusely making him look like something out of a horror movie. He motioned for Murphy to follow him and they started walking. Connor pulled two cigarettes from his pocket and lit them both, handing one to his brother. Murphy knew Connor wouldn\"t talk till he\"d finished his cigarette so they walked in silence having fallen in step. They had made it nearly to the front porch by the time Murphy had stamped his butt out. They were both freezing cold so they went inside the warmth of their house and straight up to their room. Connor washed his face for the second time that night and flopped down on his bed. Murphy, after removing his wet outerclothes did the same. \"Alright now, out with it.\" Murphy stared at his brother intently, and watched Connor wince as he propped himself up on one arm. \"Got in a fight with Katie\"s older brother.\" Murphy snorted humorlessly. \"Two beatins in one night, huh? What, did he catch ya tryin\" ta feel up Katie\"s skirt under tha mistletoe?\" Connor shook his head. \"Nah.\" When it became clear Connor wasn\"t going to add to that Murphy became irritated. \"Well what tha fuck happened then?\" Connor frowned down at his blanket, picking at a thread there. \"He...he said somethin\" real awful about ya.\" Murphy just looked blankly at Connor. He didn\"t really like Katie\"s brother and barely spoke to him. \"What tha fuck did he say?\" Murphy could barely hear when Connor spoke next. \"He called ya a dirty faggot, said one o\" his friends caught ya out back o\" tha school with another guy.\" Murphy\"s eyebrows nearly rocketed off his face and his jaw fell. He could not even form an intelligent reply to that. Connor suddenly looked horrified. \"Ya didn\"t, didja?\" That snapped Murphy back to reality. He chucked a pillow straight at Connor\"s head. \"Of course I fucken didn\"t! I haven\"t the fucken foggiest where he would come up with that shite.\" A thought occurred suddenly and Murphy groaned. \"Fuck! He\"s probably told tha whole fucken school!\" Connor smirked wickedly. \"Nah, he said it happened just today and if he knows what\"s good fer \"im he won\"t be spreadin\" that filth around. Besides, he won\"t be able ta talk right for at least two days.\" Murphy snorted, and looked pointedly at his brother. \"What about Katie?\" Connor grimaced. \"Even if her parents would let me back in her sight I wouldn\"t talk ta her again. She believed her brother and said ya always were strange.\" Murphy frowned. \"I\"m sorry Connor. I know ya liked her.\" Connor shrugged. Murphy looked at his brother, curious. \"Connor.\" \"Aye.\" \"What was it about Katie? I mean, I know she\"s cute but no offense, I thought ya\"d lose interest in a coupla weeks.\" Connor sighed heavily, getting up from his bed and changing into sweats. Murphy sat up on his bed and waited patiently for an answer. Connor sat down next to his brother and Murphy gasped when he reached over and put a hand on his face. \"She reminded me of you.\" Connor\"s hand burned his cheek, and he\"d lost the ability to breathe. Connor brought their foreheads together, and there was a tear on the end of his nose. \"I\"m so SORRY Murph.\" Murphy crushed Connor\"s lips to his own and they moaned desperately into each others mouths. Murphy kissed Connor like he was starving for it, and he shuddered violently at his brother\"s touch. They rolled together there, on the bed they\"d shared almost a year ago and Murphy couldn\"t stop the tears from streaking his down his cheeks. The wet heat of Connor\"s tongue drove away coherence and he whimpered, completely overcome. When they broke for air Connor fastened his mouth onto Murphy\"s neck, wanting to taste every beautiful inch of his brother\"s salty skin. Murphy moaned in ecstasy. \"Fuck, Murph, want ya...\" Murphy tore at his brother\"s shirt and they broke apart. They shed their clothes in almost ridiculous haste, the need to feel skin temporarily overriding sanity. The fabric gone, Murphy pressed Connor flush against him, moaning as they ground their hips together. He felt his brother\"s shivers like they were his own. Connor whimpered, pulling Murphy\"s face into his, mouths colliding in a symphony of slick heat and need. There was an inferno slowly burning them from the inside and they could not get close enough. Connor pried one of his brother\"s hands from his back and looked Murphy straight in the eye as he slowly ran his tongue over the palm side, slicking it. Murphy moaned piteously, grinding against his brother hard. \"Oh God...\" Connor guided his brother\"s hand between their fevered bodies, closing it on his own aching cock and arched hard at the touch. \"FUCK! Murph...so good...please...\" Murphy\"s eyes widened in wonder, and he immediately paid the same attention to Connor, moaning in lewd pleasure at the salty taste of his brother\"s fingers. When Connor\"s hand wrapped around his weeping cock Murphy was sure he was about to lose consciousness. Only the beauty of his brother\"s pleasure kept him on this side of reality and he watched in amazement the rapture that played out on Connor\"s face. \"God, Con...love ya...\" Connor used his free hand to crush their mouths together. Slick hands slid over swollen cocks, wet tongues communed in searing, desperate hunger and their moans of pleasure rose and fell like tides on each other\"s ears. \"Fuck...Connor...m\"gonna...\" Connor bit down hard on his brother\"s shoulder while Murphy buried his face into Connor\"s neck. Their movement grew to a frenzied pace and they both let out muffled wails, spurting into each other\"s hands. They lay like that, foreheads pressed together while the shaking subsided, sharing panting breaths. Connor pulled back to study Murphy\"s face. He smiled and wiped tears from his brother\"s flushed face and they both let out shaky laughs. \"That was...\" \"Aye.\" The heat grew overbearing and they rolled onto their backs, laying side by side. Murphy turned his head to look at Connor, favoring him with smirk before licking his hand clean. Connor\"s eyes fell to half mast and he moaned. \"Christ, Murph, you\"re a dirty motherfucker.\" Murphy grinned and pulled Connor\"s fingers to his lips. \"Lord\"s fucken name.\" Connor\"s eyes fluttered shut as his brother\"s mouth cleaned his fingers. \"Mother Mary, full of Grace...\" With what little energy still remained, Connor reached to the floor for his t-shirt and wiped him and Murphy clean. His stomach gave a loud protest of hunger. \"Fuck...\"m hungry...\" Murphy laughed, elbowing his brother. \"Aye, myself as well, but if ya think I\"m cookin\" fer ya, yer right outta yer skull. Luckily Ma left us some sandwiches.\" \"Hey Murph, Ma\"s gone fer tha night, is she not?\" \"Aye.\" Connor gave his brother a sly smile. \"Let\"s spike tha tea.\" The End. Merry Christmas!"]}

I can feel a sharp feeling at the corner of my eyes. \"Don\"t forget Breezepaw. Thunderclan actually celebrates mixed blood.\" I meow. I cannot let my son ever experience the pain I felt in love. Leafpool jerks her head backward, as if I had run my claws across her muzzle. She turns and hurries away. I feel my own heart crumbling as I catch a glimpse of her amber eyes, glittering in pain and love. Leafpool I glance at my sister and feel the bolt of fury she was feeling. I hope she doesn\"t spring onto Rowanclaw. She has matured, but I wouldn\"t put it past her to forget the truce and lose her temper. That\"s when I hear it. \"He was only speaking the truth.\" A familiar voice rumbles. My clanmates and I turn to see Crowfeather and Breezepaw. Once again, pain explodes in my chest as I stare directly into the smoky warrior\"s hard gaze. I could see his eyes glittering. Things couldn\"t be worse. Then, it does get worse. \"Don\"t forget Breezepaw. Thunderclan actually celebrates mixed blood.\" Crowfeather meows. I jerk back as I feel a jab in my heart. I couldn\"t stand it anymore. I turn and run off. I could feel the cats\" gazes burning into my fur. I just want to run from the pain. I cannot be near Crowfeather. That\"s when I bump into a form. \"Ow. I\"m sorry.\" I meow as I regain my balance. I look up and my blood turns to ice. Nightcloud. Crowfeather\"s mate. I look back and I realize that I have gone the wrong way. \"No need to apologize.\" She meows curtly. Then her voice turns smug. \"Have you seen my mate, Crowfeather?\" she meows, \"And our son, Breezepaw?\" I feel it again. The same pain in my heart. Why can\"t it leave me in peace? \"No.\" I reply, my voice shaking. I glare at Nightcloud, whose eyes are glittering, taunting me. I turn and stalk off, tail high in the air. I could feel Nightcloud\"s gaze on my fur and I could tell that she doesn\"t believe me. Yet it\"s true. I have seen Crowfeather\"s body and eyes. Yet it is not Crowfeather. This is not the tom I have loved and known. Even now, as I join my clan for our camp, I feel the pain jabbing at my heart, harder than ever. I wanted to join Starclan. Now and forever. To watch over Crowfeather and love him without pain. If only my heart tells me to join my beloved. That\"s when I catch a whiff of sweetness. I inhale as a breeze picks up. I hear the same advice a certain cat once told me. Listen to your heart... WARRIORS, Love: Heather, Lion and Honey PT: Hi again! I\"m sorry for neglecting this story but it\"s on my updating schedule now. The schedule\"s in my profile :) Thanks for the review iLovely! Honeypaw The day couldn\"t be more perfect for me. I\"m hunting with probably the best apprentice tom in all four clans: Lionpaw. He\"s brave, he\"s kind, he\"s handsome. He\"s a great warrior. He\"s determined to prove himself. His descent is of no importance to me. It doesn\"t matter that his grandfather is the great Firestar, the cat I have heard countless tales of. They\"re true. The stories are outrageous, but true. It doesn\"t matter to me that his grandmother is Sandstorm either, the clans\" best hunter and daughter of the great Redtail. The fact that Lionpaw\"s uncle was the great Hawkfrost is carrion to me. It won\"t make a difference that Tigerstar, a great cat, but evil one, is his grandfather. It\"s never going to fuel my love for Lionpaw that his aunt is Mothwing, his father the great Brambleclaw, his mother daughter of Firestar and one of the chosen cats to find a new home for our clans, or even Leafpool, Squirrelflight\"s sister and the one who found Moonpool. Everytime I see Lionpaw, I get this feeling in the depths of my heart, my very spirit. I have earlier offended Lionpaw today. I have tried to defend his honor from Mousepaw, then attempted to comfort him at the loss of his prey. That made him feel weak. I\"m truly sorry for that. I spot a mouse in a clearing. It\"s feasting on a nut, tearing the shell off. It\"s around a beech tree, so intent upon the nut. I have only thought of Lionpaw and I carefully whip around in a flash. \"Look!\" I hiss, \"That\"ll be easy to catch.\" Lionpaw stares at the mouse. I wonder if he\"s hesitating to catch it. I blink at him. Hopefully, I\"ll encourage him. \"It doesn\"t even know we\"re here,\" I meow. I wish the thing that happened next didn\"t happen. \"Why don\"t you catch it then?\" he hisses. He looked furious, like I had insulted him. I feel a jab in my heart. \"I thought you might want the chance,\" I meow. I wish I could eat my words. \"I don\"t need help!\" Lionpaw snaps at me. I feel something in me quiver and I wish he\"d understand me. I love him. I look away, feeling hopeless. I wish Lionpaw would love me back, I really do. I\"d give my life for him. I stare at a root, wishing for Lionpaw. He likes Heatherpaw, I know he does. They complete each other. The heather and lion. Heather comforts a lion\"s soreness and a lion loves the heather. I\"m nothing. Just honey that clears a lion\"s throat. I see no use in that. A lion\"s throat will clear eventually. There\"s water. I wish it was Lionpaw and me. PT: Yeah, sorry for the freakishly short chapter. I\"ll make a longer one next time. Oh, by the way, I\"m putting up a vote in this story. Choose a pairing and I might put it in the next chapter. Here are the pairings up for voting: HeatherLion...LeafCrow GoldenTiger...NightCrow CinderJay...CinderPoppy CinderLittle...FireSpotted TawnyRowan...FireSand StormBrook...BlueOak YellowRunning...SilverGray YellowRagged...GrayMillie CrowFeather...SquirrelBramble SquirrelAsh...TigerSasha WillowJay...WhiteWillow SorrelBracken...StormSquirrel RainSwallow...DaisySmoky CloudDaisy...CloudBright FernDust...MinnowMouse BlueBarley...FuzzViolet Dear everyone, There\"s not much time. I can\"t go on the internet anymore. If I come back, I\"ll private message to you if you want. Tell me in a review. My mom\"s so annoying! Till then, PT WARRIORS, Love: Denial PT: Hello again! -Grins like a moron- Thanks to everyone for their reviews! That\"s six reviews in one blow, cool. I\"ve never had that much in a single update. Anyway, thanks to everyone for voting! Those of you who have suggested other pairings to me, I have added them to the poll. Anyway, I might not be able to update next week; I\"m having a math Statewide Test. Grrr . . . I hate math. Anyway, putting that behind us, check back in case I was able to update! Enjoy this one! Willowpaw I pad to the moor with Mothwing, proud to be a medicine cat, eager to see Hollypaw again. I\"ve recently heard that her clan was invaded by ShadowClan. It\"s horrible; ShadowClan always seem so . . . evil. I mean, Littlecloud is fine and I\"ve heard of other good cats: Whitethroat, Yellowfang, Raggedstar, Boulder when he was given a second chance to be a clan cat, Tawnypelt, Dawncloud . . . well, there are a pawful of those kinds of cats. Runningnose seems to be an innocent cat too. When did ShadowClan become so . . . arrogant, to say the least? I shake such thoughts from my head and rejoice as I scent the other cats. ThunderClan is not here yet. I wait anxiously. Surely, ThunderClan cats couldn\"t be so injured that Hollypaw can\"t come. There\"s Littlecloud, the respectful tiny ShadowClan medicine cat. \"Greetings,\" he meows as he dips his head. \"How\"s it going in your clan?\" Mothwing purrs, dipping his head in returns. I bend mine for a heartbeat, then turn to watch for Hollypaw\"s black pelt. \"We\"re doing alright. Oakfur\"s got a bad limp and Tawnypelt\"s expecting.\" Mothwing blinks at the news. \"That\"s wonderful!\" she purrs. \"An addition to your ranks. \"Who\"s Tawnypelt\"s mate?\" \"Rowanclaw,\" Littlecloud replies. \"A fine warrior,\" Mothwing comments. I shift impatiently as I open my mouth for Hollypaw\"s scent. Where is she? My eyes widen as I finally smell ThunderClan. She\"s coming! Hollypaw\"s so nice. She\"s . . . Where is Hollypaw? I stare as Jaypaw appears behind Leafpool. What\"s Jaypaw doing with Leafpool? I thought he wanted to be a warrior! Wait . . . did someone mistakenly injure Hollypaw when ShadowClan . . .? I shake such thoughts from my head. After all, Hollypaw would have been in the ThunderClan camp, not around the borders. Unless she was collecting herbs . . . I hurry forward as two come closer, then stop. I\"ll ask him when\"s he\"s alone. After all, I . . . Good point, why do I want to speak to him alone? Leafpool exchanges greetings with Mothwing and Littlecloud. Maybe I should speak to him now? The very thought made my skin hot under my pelt. Why? Why am I so nervous about speaking to him? Littlecloud and Leafpool start chatting away about the effects of the Clan. \"One wound unhealed,\" Leafpool meows. \"And yours?\" \"Oakfur is still limping,\" Littlecloud meows and I feel a surge of satisfaction. ShadowClan thinks that they\"re all that, don\"t they? I would love to laugh in Oakfur\"s face. \"Try wrapping his paw with comfrey each night when he sleeps,\" Leafpool suggests. \"I\"ve run out.\" Littlecloud meows and I feel even more satisfaction. Serves Oakfur right! After all, he did attack Jaypaw\"s clan and might have injured him. That\"s unforgiva - Wait, why do I care for Jaypaw? Shouldn\"t I be worrying about Hollypaw? \"You should have come to us!\" Leafpool meows, shocked. \"Blackstar wouldn\"t let me,\" Littlecloud confesses. Now I really hate Blackstar. He\"s so prideful; he wouldn\"t even push pride aside for awhile to help his Clanmate. Plus, why did he attack ThunderClan in the first place? Thinking of ThunderClan . . . I stop listening to the conversation and pad to where Jaypaw was sitting alone, his ears pricked. I\"ve heard that he was born blind. Did ShadowClan take advantage of that? My blood turns to ice as I near him. My heart is pounding. Why? It\"s just Hollypaw\"s brother. I almost pull away when I brush my pelt against his. \"Where\"s Hollypaw?\" I ask softly. Jaypaw flicks his tail and turns his blue gaze on me. I found myself caught in its icy depths. His eyes are just so . . . blue. Yet, he glares angrily through those unseeing eyes. I hold his gaze, but I almost flinch. I feel something in my chest. What . . .? \"Don\"t you know?\" he hisses. \"Hollypaw found it so boring being a medicine cat that she let her poor, useless brother do it instead.\" I flinch. I don\"t think you\"re useless, Jaypaw! I feel hurt, deeply wounded. I was just asking! The hurt pierces into my chest, like the sharpest thorn . . . I\"m that hurt? What? It\"s not like I like him or something! I deny it completely! Denial, I feel for you, a little voice cackles in my mind. That\"s not true! He\"s stingy and grumpy! Sure. Where\"s the pain coming from, then? Stuff a fish in it! I try to shake the thoughts out of my head. It\"s not true! Denial . . . Jaypaw. . . Jaypaw Great StarClan, Willowpaw\"s annoying! Geez, just because I\"m blind doesn\"t mean I\"m useless and I can\"t be a warrior! I walk behind everyone as we make our way to Moonpool. This slope isn\"t much. After all, I do know the way. Now, I\"ll just ignore Willowpaw. \"Willowpaw!\" Mothwing. \"Walk with Jaypaw. I\"m sure he\"ll have plenty of questions about the Moonpool.\" Fox dung. I\"ve been there before, you know! Willowpaw steps near me, but she doesn\"t touch me. Hey! Come closer! That is . . . er . . . so I could mock you! Wow, that was a lame excuse. So, why do I want her closer? It\"s not like I like her or anything! \"Has Leafpool brought you here yet?\" she mews and I could tell that she\"d rather be anywhere but here. Oh, I smell a rabbit hole. Time to avoid it. I guess I\"ll just answer Willowpaw and sidestep it at the same time. I open my mouth to- I feel teeth meet my scruff. Willowpaw! Why are you dragging me sideways?! I unsheathe my claws and wriggle away. I break free. Yes! See? I can manage! You mouse-brain! I lunge. Mouse-brain. \"Jaypaw!\" Leafpool screeches. \"What are you doing?!\" I part my jaws to reply, but Willowpaw replies first. \"He almost fell down a rabbit hole! I was just trying to help him! I sheathe my claws, and my ears are on fire. She was only trying to help. Just trying to help, like any medicine cat would. \"I didn\"t know!\" I snap. I didn\"t know. I just wondered if she was trying to help me walk or something like that. I\"m not that pathetic. I\"m not a kit! Unfortunately, Leafpool is faster than me. \"That\"s no excuse! Apologize!\" She sounds furious. \"I\"m sorry.\" So annoying . . . Willowpaw is so mad, she growls. \"That\"s okay.\" Not with you, really. \"Next time I hope you fall in!\" I\"m not that helpless! She walks away angrily, flicking my nose. Hey, she touched me! I keep walking with the others. Yeah, she touched me, so what? I hate her! Hm, I heard that Firestar and Sandstorm hated each other before, when they were apprentices. Oh, what does that have to do with me!? I come to stone, it\"s slippery from the frost. I try to be careful. Steady . . . Hey! I\"m- GAH! I\"m slipping! Willowpaw\"s coming! She\"s- Hey, she stopped! So she was serious about not helping me! Wow, so stubborn and she never backs off from her word. Ow, the rock\"s hard We walk on, but Willowpaw never helps me whenever I come to a problem. She has such self-control. Hmph. It\"s not like I really admire her or anything. Well, okay, she is kind of . . . I deny admiring her! It\"s not denial! PT:I\"m scared. I think Jaypaw\"s out of character. Thanks to everyone for their reviews! I\"m so happy, I could cry! Anyway, people have suggested new pairings so I put them on the vote. Please vote and review! HeatherLion...Hawkfrost/Pick a cat!

On my last update, I realized that I said that I had the math test, but I made a mistake; by the time I updated, I\"ve already finished the test. I\"m ssssssssooooooooooooooooooooo sorry. Don\"t hurt me! T/.\\T So...triple update! Mhmmm... If I don\"t update the second story today, I\"ll do it tomorrow. I can\"t complain; I am a pre-teen after all. Brackenfur: Dude, that makes no sense. PT: GET OUT!! -Brackenfur leaves- PT: Anyway, here are some review replies: Stahle Er... Excuse me? What? inktongue58 Yeah, it does get annoying. I can\"t exactly blame Jaypaw for being so mad, but you don\"t/didn\"t see Cinderpelt or Longtail complaining. Oh! Plus, you like the Inkheart trilogy, don\"t you? Love those books! Oh, that was random, lol. Rainwhisker I inhale deeply as I search for one cat in particular. I haven\"t seen this cat in so long, it seems. I just want to feel her again, drink in her scent, know that she is there. We have become friends during the Great Journey, maybe even more. It\"s just that she has been there for me and I have tried to be there for her. It was wonderful, really. At first, I found it awkward that there were no longer boundaries between the Clans. Then, I met Swallowtail. She comforted me, shared her feelings with me, even though she was from RiverClan. I\"ve never felt the same again. It is hard explain; how my life changed and all. I can only feel this change, literally feel it, and the only way for one to get a proper explanation is to feel it yourself. It hurt when I had to leave Swallowtail, it hurt. Leaders supposedly feel the worst pain when they get their nine lives, but I think different. There\"s a worse pain. This pain is love. When you lose it, it hurts more. When it\"s broken, failed, it hurts that much as well, more or less. That\"s what I felt. I barely got to know my father, my mother died saving my brother. My aunt died much too early. Mistyfoot and Stonefur... Well, Stonefur died and Mistyfoot... It doesn\"t seem right, she is RiverClan\"s deputy. Swallowtail... I sniff her out in this Gathering. She must be here! I spot her, a little ways away from Brambleclaw, who\"s going after his sister. I head off at once. I rush past many cats, but I don\"t give a fox-dung about it. All that matters is the dark RiverClan tabby sitting farther off, looking around the Gathering. I wonder if she is looking for me too, I wish we could have been together. That\"s a flaw in being in Clans: boundaries force love into something forbidden. I just really like Swallowtail, but I\"m not saying that I love her that much. Okay, I do wish that we could go as far as mating, but that is impossible. She reminds me of the past, of Mother, of Father. I don\"t know why, she just does. I feel the energy building up now, pressure in my limbs. Those words that I had wanted to say again are on the tip of my tongue, screaming for release, screaming for a chance to be displayed to the tabby she-cat. \"Hi, Swallowtail! How\"s the prey running?!\" To my dismay, I remember that things are different now, we have boundaries again. Swallowtail shoots a questioning glance at Leopardstar, sitting a few tail-lengths away. \"Fine,\" the leader murmurs. I find my heart beating again, I feel like I am about to explode, what with all the building pressure in my body. I bend-Swallowtail is slightly shorter than me-to lick Swallowtail around the ears, just like what I used to do on the Great Journey, when we shared tongues freely. Suddenly, a piece of ice falls into the pit of my stomach. I\"m thinking as I near and I freeze. This is wrong. I jerk back, my head spinning. I am...a loyal ThunderClan...warrior... I am...a...honorable warrior, member of ThunderClan...who knows of the old days and new ones...and will never forget our old home, which we had lived in for...StarClan knows how long. I consciously lick my own paw and swipe it over my face, but I\"m already embarrassed. I absolutely loathe this moment. I hope no one else saw me try to lick Swallowtail. Things are different now... Very true, but I wish they weren\"t. \"Sorry,\" I meow quietly, \"I keep forgetting, things are different now.\" She licks me. I blink. \"Yes,\" she meows seriously, \"but it\"s all right to do this at Gatherings. We aren\"t breaking the warrior code to be friendly at this point. \"It do feel that we\"d best let our leaders know that we have not forgotten our places.\" That explains why she had asked for permission from Leopardstar. \"Our Clan is doing well,\" I murmur. Swallowtail flicks my ear with her tail; she used to always do that on the journey. \"So\"s ours,\" she meows. Swallow me up, Swallowtail, I want to be with you forever. Swallow me up and end the pain of losing you to the laws of our ancestors. I\"ll only ever let you hurt me. Although you don\"t mean it, it\"s because of the warrior code. I\"d never let anyone but you harm me, because I really like you, and I trust you to never hurt me intentionally, even for the sake of your Clan. Yet, to tell the truth, dear Swallowtail, you...not intentionally, but you... ...You already had. Swallowtail I gasp as I hear the news at the Gathering. No... It can\"t be...it just can\"t! NO! PLEASE! StarClan, NO! Don\"t let it be true, oh, please! Don\"t let it be true... Please, no. I pray to StarClan... Please, don\"t let it be true. It\"s a lie, I know it is. He can\"t be gone. He couldn\"t have left me... No... Firestar bows his head as he breaks the news. Please, StarClan, don\"t let him repeat that lie again- \"Rainwhisker is dead.\" NO! I unsheathe my claws and let them sink into the earth beneath me. No... Please, that... I won\"t accept it! That\"s a lie! A LIE! I will not accept such a LIE! I\"m an elder now, elder forevermore until I join the ranks of my warrior ancestors. Only, I want to join now. It\"s a lie that Rainwhisker is dead, but I still need to join. For, there, there are no boundaries of love. We shall walk the skies forever there, in the Great Beyond. Till then, I shall continue to hear the lie that Rainwhisker is dead. For I shall never accept that he is gone. It is a lie. The grief, however, still tears at my heart. It\"s raining there, in my chest, the raindrops cold and hard, coming out in a spray, making the drops feel like thorns. He is not gone. That lie... Raining upon an incomplete hole in my heart. PT: Well, these ideas are sprouting from real life experience, so please don\"t ask. Er... Please R&R! Brackenfur: Please vote! We\"ve got some really cool results!

Brambleclaw: You know, Demi, Brackenfur\"s acting crazy around the camp. The other day, he was attempting to eat a pebble while singing I Must Be Emo! THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT!!", "direction. Clay, who was awake at last, asked \"So, where is it?\" Dojo made a face as he answered, \"The Ying-Yang World.\" Omi held back a shudder. That was how he became evil and joined Chase Young. \"I\"ve got the Yin yoyo,\" Clay dug the half out of his hat. \"I\"ve got the Yang yoyo.\" Kimiko pulled the other half out of her pocket. The two dragon warriors placed the two halves together. Omi took it and handed it to the Brazilian Wind dragon. \"Raimondo, will you do the honors?\"Raimondo took the Shen Gong Wu with a grin. \"With pleasure...\" he said. \"YIN YANG YOYO!\" Please review! I\"ve only had a couple so far. PT: Chapter 2 is up! I\"d like to thank firecracker-girl and xxFireWarriorxx for their reviews. I will try to write this chapter with more detail. To answer xxFireWarriorxx\"s post script, this fic will be something like a movie, but there will be something in their future lives I made up, if you know what I mean. Enjoy! The silence in the Yin-Yang World was unnerving. In the prison, prisoners were only just settling back into their gloomy silence, after their little spell with the monks. They had been silent for a long time 1500 years ago, but only about a year ago, they had been aroused as the Chi Guardian had left with the Xiaolin Monks. Chi had been stolen and placed in the Yin-Yang World. An inmate, a certain bean who has never heard of toothpaste, escaped by means of the monks and a little evil wannabe who still sleeps with a nightlight and fears toilets. At last, there was something the prisoners could actually think about. Only, it had been what seemed like an eternity since there was anything new. For the Chi Guardian was returned, the monks didn\"t need to return and no more Shen Gong Wu were brought there, meaning that no more Silver Manta Rays could explode in midair. Today must have been blessed, as suddenly, a portal opened up in midair. Before you could say \"O.o\", the giant, 40-foot dragon by the name of Dojo stopped flying in midair as the portal closed...and fell. \"AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\" the monks (and Dojo) screamed as they fell towards the Yin-Yang World\"s cloudy ground. \"Remind me next time that Dojo can\"t fly in the Yin-Yang World!\" Raimondo yelled at Omi. \"Shut down Raimondo!\" Omi screamed, \"It is you who are leader!\" \"You\"re the smart one! Besides, it\"s \"shut up\", Omi!\" \"Incoming!\" Dojo yelled. As the dust cleared from Dojo\"s vveeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrry smooth landing, the Chi Guardian awakened... \"Look at all the pretty stars,\" Dojo mumbled as he got up, now back to his \"gecko\" form. \"Oof!\" Raimondo gasped as he tried to get Clay off of him. Omi and Kimiko got up and dusted themselves. Clay carefully got up and backed away from Raimondo, rubbing his back. \"Well,\" Kimiko commented nonchalantly as she watched Raimondo crick his back, \"So much for the almighty leader.\" Raimondo glared as he stood up. He opened his mouth to say something, but Dojo cut him off. He twisted into weird shapes and spun around desperately. \"Hurry UP!\" he shrieked, \"This Wu gives me measles.\" (Crickets chirp) The monks stared for a real long time. Then, in unison: \"EW!!!!!\" A While Later... \"I think the Wu is in the prison,\" Kimiko said thoughtfully. Raimondo blanched, but his head chanted the same thing. Prison...Prison...Prison... \"Absolutely! I say we go over to the prison, take the Shinobi Star and blow this taco stand.\" Raimondo declared, trying not to look at Kimiko. \"They have tacos here?\" Omi asked stupidly. Raimondo wanted to strangle himself. Clay slapped himself and Dojo sweat-dropped. Kimiko stared. \"Huh?!\" Omi looked completely clueless, that cute little cheeseball. The rest of the monks shook their heads and decided to leave that question unanswered. \"Let\"s go,\" Raimondo said and then started in the direction of the prison. The rest of the monks shrugged and followed him. They haven\"t gone more than 5 yards when, out of nowhere, a stand just appeared. The monks screamed, then stared at the sight before them. The stand was all yellow, with a giant sombrero on the top. The sombrero was yellow as well, with zigzags, green and red, around the spot sombreros usually have zigzags. On the front of the stand, a giant steaming taco bore the sign, a giant, neon red sign: FREE TACOS Omi yelped in delight. \"There really are tacos here!\" he squealed. The taco guy in the stand stared. Not really becoming of a Shoku warrior. Omi rushed up. He didn\"t have any breakfast today, being woken up by Dojo at 4:54A.M. for the new Wu. The monks followed him silently, too stunned to speak. \"Two tacos please!\" Omi said excitedly. He squinted at the menu next to the taco guy. \"Chicken tacos! Parrot style!\" Omi beamed. Omi happily chomped on his taco as his friends stared at him. Dojo exploded from his spot on Clay\"s hat. \"SHEN GONG WU!!!!!!!\" There was another shriek from our favorite cheeseball. He lifted his head. There, clamped between his teeth was a blackish silver shurikan, its four sharp points gleaming. \"The shurikan star!\" Raimondo yelled, plucking the star from Omi\"s mouth. Kimiko made a face. \"Yes!\" Dojo yelled, obviously relieved that measles won\"t start randomly coming out of his scales. \"Let us suck this taco stand!\" Omi yelled triumphantly. (Crickets chirping) \"Uhh...yeah...right...\" Kimiko muttered. \"LET\"S BLOW THIS TACO STAND!\" Raimondo yelled, ignoring Omi\"s scream of \"That too!\" Raimondo took the Yin-Yang Yoyo from his pocket. \"Yin-Yang Yoyo!\" As the newly made Shoku warriors left the inky kanji world, the prisoners were sure they\"d be bored again. No one thought they\"d returned again, that the unthinkable would happen as evil started to grow inside one of the monk\"s hearts. TO Be Continued... PT: Right, a cliffhanger at last! Hope you like the next chapter, when there will be more action! Including SHOKU POWER! Yay! Please comment! PT: Chapter 3 is up! I have a slight writer\"s block so some suggestions would be welcome. Plus, owing to the fact that I may be one of the youngest writers on fanfic net (I\"m not sure. I\"m 13; really), I have a State Test next week, so updates will have to wait awhile. There\"s going to be a fight scene in here, but I\"m bad at those, so please don\"t kill me! I\"m sorry! Anyways, enjoy! It was like any other day. Master Fung hadn\"t called the monks in for training yet and the monks had finished their chores. So the warriors were sitting around. Kimiko was playing Mindcreeper and Clay was wrestling a pig. Omi and Raimondo were pretending to play Steal the Wu. Dojo lounged lazily in the sun, feasting on barbecue and hot sauce. What could break this peaceful moment of idling? You\"ll see... Master Fung stepped into grounds, where the monks were hanging out, followed by a 12-year-old girl. \"Young monks,\" he called out, catching the monks\" attention at once, \"We have a new warrior among us.\" The monks immediately gave the girl rapt attention. She was unusually tall with black hair in a ponytail that streamed down her back. She had hard, black eyes and something about her face that said \"Don\"t mess with me\". Her frame was wide hips, a muscular back and broad shoulders. In short, she scared Dojo. Well, he got scared easily anyway, so whatever. When she spoke, she had an unusually quiet voice. \"Hey.\" She was American. \"Ooohhhhhhhhhh. Did mine ears play games with me? A new warrior?!\" Omi gasped. \"It\"s true,\" the girl said, \"I hail from Flushing and I\"ve been training myself in street-fighting and climbing since I started to jump too much. I went learning Kung Fu and Jujitsu when I was ten. Master Fung invited me here telling me that I\"m supposed to become a Shoku warrior with four other warriors and use the element of thunder. My name\"s Drew Werd. You\"re the monks aren\"t you?\" \"Yeah,\" Raimondo stated \"By the way, are you really good enough to be a Shoku warrior so soon?\" Drew glanced at Master Fung uncertainly. Master Fung gave a small nod. \"SHOKU WOLF, THUNDER!\" Drew yelled as she jumped in the air. Blue lightning crackled and swirled in the air and landed in her palms. Her shadow became blue as well and crept all over her. In short, Drew looked like a lightning spirit. Drew looked at some boulders and trees nearby. Focusing, she made a dive for them and swiped. There was a slight flash as the boulders were reduced to a heap of dark ash. Drew landed neatly in front of the monks and looked at Raimondo. \"O.o\" (Crickets chirping) 5 minutes later... \"We\"ve got a new Shen Gong Wu!!!!!!!!!\" Dojo yelled as he slithered into the Wu chamber, where Master Fung was presenting Drew\"s signature Wu, the Eye of Dashi, to her. \"What\"s the Wu?\" Kimiko asked as she fingered the Star of Hanabi lovingly. The monks rushed off to the grounds as Master Fung bid them farewell. Dojo grew to his 40-foot form and the monks jumped on. Drew lodged herself between Kimiko and Omi. Kimiko took her comb out and Dojo started flying. \"Well,\" Dojo began, taking the Wu scroll from his pocket, \"It says here that the River Kunai is supposed to be able to travel long distances as a throwing knife. It can also be used to cling onto when you\"re underwater. It\"ll go forward in any direction you want and you\"ll be able to breathe as long as you hold onto it or someone or something that\"s already holding it.\" \"Pretty cool.\" Raimondo said in awe. \"Oooooohhhhh. It will be moooooooost useful and fun to travel without having to swim!\" Omi squealed. \"So where is it?\" Clay asked as he straightened his hat. \"Tokyo, in the country.\" Dojo answered breezily. \"Home sweet ho-\" Kimiko broke off as she stared at one of the birds flying alongside them. She suddenly felt uneasy. \"Huh?\" Omi and Drew looked at her. \"Eeeerrrrrrr......\" Kimko started to sweat. \"Evil boy genius! Prince of darkness! At your service!\" a voice bragged as a freaky Goth kid came by. He was surrounded by his robots. He was flying alongside Dojo by means of a couple of propellers. \"Jack Spicer! Prepare for a mooooost humiliating defeat!\" Omi yelled. It would be easier to get rid of him right now than have a showdown with him for the Wu later. The monks jumped up, prepared for battle. Kimiko was actually glad to see him. \"JACKBOTS! ATTACK!\" Jack gave the usual command. \"Warriors! Get in formation!\" Omi yelled. \"SHOKU DRAGON FORMATION!!!\" the monks yelled. The monks immediately had their shadows creep up upon them like armor. Jack Spicer\"s jaw dropped. \"HUH!??!?!?!?!\" \"SHOKU WHALE, WATER!\" \"SHOKU LION, FIRE!\" \"SHOKU WOLF, THUNDER!\" \"SHOKU BUZZARD, WIND!\" \"SHOKU BULL, EARTH!\" Omi\"s hands were already swirling with fierce water as he summoned a tsunami out of nowhere. He went for some robots and Jack. Kimiko\"s arms weren\"t even visible under all the swirling flames. She charged, throwing fireballs and blowing fire out of her mouth. Drew was using lightning in her palms again, swiping them like swords. Raimondo brought up a hurricane and charged, blowing wind out of his mouth. Clay used his hands to bring up boulders from the ground so far below. His arms turned to massive stone limbs as he smashed a robot. \"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!\" Spicer was already screaming as Omi pummeled him with water. His propellers broke. Kimiko was just swiping for him when he brought up an extra pair. \"DAMN YOU! MY AUNTIE GAVE ME THOSE FOR VALENTINE\"S DAY!!\" Drew stopped swiping at a crowd of bots to look down at the fleeing freak in surprise. There were people wimpy as that? \"Never mind that Drew!\" Clay yelled, smashing the bots with some boulders. \"I agree!\" Raimondo yelled as he blew the last of the bots away. \"Other evil might want the Shen Gong Wu!\" Kimiko punched the last of the bots as she thought of Hannibal Roy Bean. As the monks scrambled back on Dojo, Kimiko looked over her shoulder again. In the midst of the others chatting over their victory, she couldn\"t help but think that they were being watched... \"The monks have grown well.\" Chase Young commented in his lair. He was watching the monks through a crystal ball. Wuya was, thankfully, in his 5-star bathroom. He didn\"t want her to see this. She was annoying enough as it is. He turned, a slight, familiar smirk crossing his face. It is time...for the seeds of evil grip to the chosen monk...for prophecy to take hold... PT: Alright! Please review! I\"ve got to go now; my dog\"s hopping mad for the bathroom. Is Chase Young behind the evil going on in a monk\"s head? Mmmmmmmmmmaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyyybbbbbbbbbbbbbbeeeeeeee... Again, sorry the stupid fight scene. I\"m bad those. Again, suggestions are welcome! PT: Chappy 4! Yay! Anyway, to Aria Pedrosa, I\"d like to say that I\"m 12 too, in 7th grade. I\"m technically 13, according to my nationality. I guess I don\"t have to worry that much though. My birthday is coming up in August. It brings a lot of stuff. In 2009, I\"ll have to move to a different town. It\"s close to the town I live in now, but I\"m still sad! I\"ve lived in this town for my whole life! I feel jealous of people who have lived in the towns they loved their whole lives and never even plan to move away. I\"ll lose my braces too. The freedom is something I itch for. I\"d like to thank everyone for reviews! Anyway, I hope you enjoy this chapter! \"There it is!\" Raimundo called out, gesturing at field. Dojo had finally taken the monks to the country to Tokyo. He had taken them to a field of cherry blossom trees, or a haruno of sakura, as Kimiko called it. Raimundo gestured again as the other monks whipped their heads around. \"Huh?\" Omi, our cuddly cheeseball, was clearly confused. (Crickets chirping) \"You sure you spotted our Wart?\" Omi and Kimiko turned to look at Clay, who had his mouth open. \"Clay,\" Raimundo said, not turning around, \"You sound like your sister.\" \"That wasn\"t me!\" Clay sputtered, his blond hair lifting so you could see both of his eyes. \"Then who-\" \"It was us!\" a shrill, happy voice cried out. The voice was familiar, veeeeeerrrrrrrrrry familiar... \"Jessie! Megan!\" Omi exclaimed, wide eyed as he gawked at the girls. \"Yo!\" Raimundo waved as he finally turned around, obviously pleased at the sight of the two girls. Drew raised an eyebrow. \"Old friends?\" she inquired of Dojo. \"Yup.\" Dojo replied. \"Well, who\"s this?\" Jessie asked cheerfully, gesturing towards Drew. \"That\"s Drew, for thunder.\" Clay passed out the info breezily, obviously pleased to see his sister without having to tie each other up and attempt to toss each other of a bridge. \"New warrior, huh?\" Jessie asked, looking Drew up and down. \"Uh.\" Drew was obviously freaked out. \"Hi!\" Megan said cheerfully, waving, \"I met this girl with a Shen Gong Wu while I was on vacation here! We both talked a little when I pointed the Wu out and she brought me here, saying she had a tracking device for activated Shen Gong Wu that she stole from my stupid cousin, Jack! So we both figured you knew both of us so I went with Jessie!\" Jessie and Megan were both on Jessie\"s motorcycle, with the Wings of Tanabi attached to the back. \"Hello! Wu anybody?\" a voice called out. \"Huh?\" The monks, Dojo, Jessie and Megan spun around. There, in the sunlight, was a tall, barefoot witch with long, red hair and creepy eye-makeup.Omi was already screaming. \"WUYARETURNTHESHENGONGWUORSUFFERAMOOOOOOOOOOOOOSSTHUMILIATINGDEFEAT!\" (Crickets chirping) \"Ooookaaaaaaaayyyy...\" Kimiko muttered. There was an uncomfortable silence as everyone followed Omi\"s gaze to the object in Wuya\"s hand. It was a silvery-blue kunai knife. \"Oh no you ain\"t!\" Jessie yelled as she tossed her lasso. The loop immediately closed around the kunai. Unfortunately, Clay had let his own trusty lasso out as well. His loop bumped off of Jessie\"s on contact and instead of getting the kunai, he got...Wuya\"s wrist. Wuya grinned evilly and quickly took control of the situation. She gave a flick of her wrists...and sent the blond siblings tumbling toward a large boulder on the ground, to their deaths. \"AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!\" Jessie found herself being jerked out of the motorcycle as the end of the lasso in her hand slipped out of her grasp. She fell, screaming and feeling fluttery in the stomach. Clay screamed even louder as he was pulled off Dojo. He clutched his lasso...finding it to be cut in the middle. The air pressure was too much... \"NNNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!\" Kimiko screamed as she launched herself off Dojo, heading for her friends. \"Shoku lion, fire!\" As she summoned fire, she felt something grabbing her wrist. \"No!\" The fire died down as Wuya tightened her grasp on Kimiko\"s wrist. Raimundo was already in the air, eyes trained on the Japanese warrior... ...As Wuya grabbed him too. \"Well, I\"ve done a nice job today.\" Wuya commented sickeningly, as Omi screamed and went after Clay, Megan right behind him, eyes on Jessie. Drew went for Wuya, eyes determined. Wuya grinned as she tightened her grasp on the struggling Raimundo and Kimiko. \"A Shen Gong Wu...\" Omi and Megan caught the Texan siblings right before they hit the boulder... \"...and two hostages...\" With that, she disappeared just as Drew released a punch...into thin air. \"No!\" Omi screamed. Clay had seen the whole thing. As soon as he got back on Dojo, he took the Fist of Tebigong from his pocket and punched himself. Jessie and Megan just sniffed as Jessie settled down in her motorcycle. Dojo started sobbing...no...bawling. As for Drew, the kid just tipped back her head and howled... All around the world, people suddenly felt jabs in their hearts for no reason at all. Soon, there wasn\"t a dry eye in the heavens or hell. PT: Hope this fight scene was okay. Thanks for all the reviews! I\"ve got a new stream of ideas coming so...yeah... Anyway, no problem. I won\"t make Drew a Mary Sue. Never intended to but I could have made her one accidentally.) Anyway, thanks for reading and reviewing! PT: Hi everybody! ;) I hope you like this chapter! I am hoping to be able to start a pairing in this chapter. You may already know what the pairing is...or not... Anyways, enjoy and please review! Kimiko crawled over to Raimundo. Wuya had taken them to a giant birdcage about as tall as Jack Spicer\"s house, with a diameter of 10 feet. She had left them with their hands tied behind their backs before she left, sniggering. Kimiko and Raimundo could see outside the cage, but there wasn\"t much to see. They were in a grassy field. All they could see was grass, in every direction. Kimiko doubted that they could get away easily. Wuya would definitely be watching and in this field, it won\"t be hard to catch the monks. The only thing they could do was untie themselves. Kimiko nudged Raimundo. \"Wake up!\" she whispered fiercely. She wasn\"t going to sound desperate in front of him. It might give away how worried she was about him. The Brazilian teen opened his eyes. They stared at Kimiko a moment before closing them again. \"Don\"t.\" he moaned wearily. \"Raimundo!\" Raimundo\"s eyes snapped open. His olive green eyes stared at the Japanese warrior. Huh. Now that I think of it, I never really told her how nice her eyes are. I\"ve never seen a more brilliant blue color. \"Raimundo!\" Kimiko snapped, \"Stay awake and help me think of how to escape!\" She\"s cute when she\"s angry. \"How do we get out of here?\" Raimundo asked, deciding to go along. It\"s not like he could go to sleep again. Kimiko would keep prodding him and even resort to beating him up if he won\"t heed her. Raimundo cringed at the thought. Well, if she does, we\"ll be touching each other at the very least. He shook his head. Huh? He had really just thought that? He was so distracted by his thoughts that he didn\"t notice when Kimiko slapped him. \"Earth to Raimudo!\" \"Whuh?\" Kimiko glared at the Xiaolin leader. \"You are our leader! We need to escape to help the others! Who knows what\"ll happen to the other monks if we aren\"t there? Master Fung always taught us about teamwork!\" Raimundo nodded, a numb feeling in his chest. \"Right.\" Teamwork. It seemed to Raimundo that that was what stood in the way of having a relationship with Kimiko. He always cared for his friends. It felt wrong to have feelings for one of them. That would mean he favored one. Raimundo stood up, the numb feeling still in his chest. \"What do you have in mind?\" he asked. Kimiko stared at him for a long time. The only sound was the wind blowing through the grass. Finally, Raimundo broke the silence. \"You were the one worried about escaping!\" he accused, \"Answer me!\" That seemed to do the trick. Kimiko snapped out of whatever had kept her silent and staring. \"Oh! Right.\" She seemed embarrassed. Hey, did she just turn red? \"Alright, here\"s the plan. It\"s what I can think of at the moment. You probably won\"t like it, but here\"s a plan I\"ll suggest for now.\" Kimiko leaned forward. \"You\"ll never believe this, but...\" PT: Yeah, hope this was good. It\"s short, but I\"m slightly busy now. My mom\"s making me decide when to go to Paris. Yay! Paris! Anyway, that nagging is kind of annoying and I hate my mom. Sorry, did I say mom? I mean disowned mom. Forget it. As soon as I turn 18, I\"m not having her in my life again. I wish I could actually disown now. For now, I\"m not speaking to her. Anyway, I need to double check my homework. I\"m in a bit of a cranky mood now. I\"m sorry! ;( Dear everyone, There\"s not much time. I can\"t go on the internet anymore. If I come back, I\"ll private message to you if you want. Tell me in a review. My mom\"s so annoying! Till then, PT PT: OMG, I have no excuse myself for avoiding this fic for sooooo long :( On a brighter side, I\"m updating this again but it\"s going to be kind of slow. Good news though: I\"m almost done with my Naruto Christmas fic, so as soon as I finish that, I can update quickly again! :) Anyway, yeah, I do have problems with my mom. I\"ve hit that age. Anyway, here we go!"]}

There was no time for apologies. Cackling echoed from across the room, as a thick cluster of soot and smoke enveloped both Asterion and Hades. Asterion barely had time to scream. Once rich, colourful eyes shining with a forgotten hope, now only fulled by a raging fire scorching his belly. Those same eyes remained wide, while his upper twitched into a snarl: Giving him a sinister almost comical look of both horror and rage. Stumbling across charred ground, one curled hand dragging lifelessly, across fearsome looking rocks. \"I failed her... No.. No I didn\"t fail her. She failed me... She. Failed. Me!' Pausing in both wollering of self pity and walk, Asterion gazed upwards. Thick black clouds, mixed with crimson gashes across their underbelly, traveled slowly. \"Is he watching me, right now? Even after he sent me down to this, pit of hell, he still wishes to taunt me...' An inhuman laugh began to erupt from Asterion\"s jaws. His whole body started to shake, knees began to wobble. Wrapping an arm across his belly, clutching, tearing at his naked side. Fine hairs pushed through clenched knuckles, instead of thick bull fur. Collapsing hard onto the ground, Asterion only laughed harder. Tears spilled down quivering cheekbones. Long, unruly hair hung casting a shadow across twisted facial features. Thick shoulder blades quivered and rippled beneath muscled flesh. No longer hooves, but feet began to slip within the over burnt ground. There was no trace of the Minotaur left. Only a terrified man, banished to Tarturas. How could he have been so foolish? No undeserving reward goes unpunished... *Peeks out* Hello strangers. I\"m so sorry for the delay in updates, things have been very hectic as of lately. I promise you this story will be finished by August. Do hope you enjoyed this delayed chapter. Please leave a review. - Signed The Broken Ghost Shamed. Mutilated - Tarturas. \"Is this you being the hero, and killing the beast?' His body still burnt. Eyes blood shot. A quivering mess from the once, over powering, obsessed king of Crete. Minos stood trembling, watching spirits drift effortlessly, some clutching precious coins to their chest. Always so watchful. Even in death robbery was still feared. It seemed almost comical considering, real danger stood poised just a few feet behind them. With three snarling, drooling heads. A sense of dread and foreboding washed over Minos. Everyone knew, that to cross the river, you needed a coin. For once, none loitered his smoldering clothes. There was only one thing for it. Thievery. Picking a victim wasn\"t hard. Those who weren\"t rocking like confused children along Styx\"s river bank, walked in some sort of trance. It wasn\"t all surprising. The only light source was a small trickle between Cerberus\"s hind quarters, and half light wooden flames. Truth be told, walking wasn\"t painful. Despite obvious wounds, they served more as a nuisance than weakness. Creeping across soot coloured sand, Minos\"s creepy eyes laid upon a small child. No older than nine. Its hollow, albino flesh with coal black eyes, chapped lips and frail body didn\"t leave much to reason of death. Thinking about touching such a diseased creature, would\"ve made Minos vomit in disgust. Now however, he looked upon it like a starving wolf drooling over a fly, flea infested corpse. Pouncing upon the child, wrapping his arms tightly around its waist, poising his body as ready for a strike, the child barley moved. Shrugging off his prey\"s lack of struggle, Minos ripped a single coin from the boys limp grip. It didn\"t matter to Minos, that the coin was placed by its mother. All that mattered was boarding Charon\"s boat. A few shades/spirits turned their heads. Hollow gazes focused upon him. Shifting. A hungry growl escaped one. Much like Minos, it didn\"t bare a coin. Shuffling across the black sand, its withered remaining form quivering. It reached towards Minos, mouth agape in a hideously shaped roar. But Minos didn\"t even flinch. As it rose its hand ready to strike, Minos moved swiftly towards Charon who waited patiently for others to board his boat. Swiping his hand, the older shade scratched across Minos\"s back. Hideous wounds should\"ve appeared, along with fallen burnt flesh. Instead, the shades hand simply cut through Minos like two shadows joining. It fell upon its knees, hissing, roaring in outrage. While Minos, merrily skipped, coin dangling proudly between his fingertips. Upon closer inspection, upon the fallen shade its clothing was not from the same time as Minos\"s. They were older. Baggy. Simple. This was a shade from the Titan era. A forgotten soul. If the old man noticed, any heart wrenching crime, he spoke no word of it. Instead, uncoiling his hand, watching with sunken eyes as Minos dropped a simple coin upon his palm. He welcomed the fallen king, by pushing the boat away expecting him to follow swiftly. Luckily, Minos was in no mood to be dragged down to Styx\"s watery underbelly. Perched on a splintered wooden seat, keeping as far from the water, which reminded Minos of a thousand arms just waiting to drag someone away from their judgement. Every so often, Minos could\"ve sworn he saw a cheeky wink. Just maybe some saw this as an easier escape, than having their past life being retold. Looking away, in fear that such sights would render him hysterical, Minos gazed towards Charon who remained silent through out their journey. Despite his aging features, it was clear that beneath his crimson cloak, lay a healthy body. Who else could push such a boat through living water? It felt like they\"d been traveling for hours. With each push of Charon\"s oar, Minos\"s stomach churned. Guilt. Fear. Though he would defend his honor, for he was king, this wasn\"t his throne. What would Lord Hades bring out from his darkened past? Peering over his charcoal coloured shoulder, Minos saw the robbed boy standing on the sands uneven edge. Twisting himself around, gripping on Charon\"s boat, Minos watching in a mixture of horror and dark humor as the boy stepped forward. Styx\"s current slithered up the youth\"s leg. Not once did Minos witness a struggle. Both moved silently. Blackened eyes flickered shut as the boys body moved further. A faint gasp passed dehydrated lips, before a wave in the shape of a rotten arm came over his head pulling him under. No bubbles broke the surface. Falling back within the boat, Minos only just released that he was gasping for breath. Though no oxygen could be sort, he didn\"t panic. For within death, breath was useless. Charon watched silently. He to had seen the boys demise. There was nothing he could do, nor should\"ve such an act been allowed. Ever since Melione\"s disappearance, things had been left to rot. A sad grin stretched Charon\"s mouth. It was a poor pun even for him. Hearing Minos speak, Charon broke his gaze to stare down at the king, strewn upon his back gazing up at the slow moving rock formation ceiling. \"I always thought, it was either your way or dodging the terrible trio\" \"It is. Those who willingly plunge, will be dragged out. Don\"t doubt my ruler\" Instead of becoming silent, Minos let out a sickening chuckle. Rolling over onto his side, hiding within Charon\"s boat shadow, Minos\"s body rocked in time with the waves. \"I never said I would. I look forward to meeting him.\" Curling a hairy upper lip in disgust, Charon looked away. Land was gaining closer. A few shadowed creatures, seemed to hop around. Silver drool hanging from their long snouts. They knew who his boat rider was. Charon didn\"t doubt their ability to get Minos to Hades feet, what worried him was how Minos would slip out of punishment. It turned out that Charon, had great reason to fear such an outcome... Present Time Hidden away like a dirty secret. No excited whispers of a celebration feast. Melione trembled like a dying mouse upon tangled sheets. What ever logical sense her father once had, now remained covered in shadows. His once powerful voice, able to paint pictures without aid of magic, caused her dried sobs to turn into sickening heaves. She had no time to speak with him. Her mother ushered her straight past the throne room. Couldn\"t she understand, the amount of fear striking through her body like one of Zeus\"s thunderbolts? Asterion wasn\"t a monster. But if what Persephone whispered to her through chattering teeth, it would take a miracle for Hades to turn the other cheek. Rolling slowly upon her left side, Melione\"s tears hung on the tip of her noes. Head perfectly cushioned within the crook of her arm. Everything smelt of him. She refused to change, after her mother returned with clothing; a hideous look of guilt written across her face. Persephone had been less than thrilled. Even when Melione held her breath, preparing her sharp tongue for a battle of wits, there was a small glint within Persephone\"s eyes. Understanding; Not just from a mothers intuition but something deeper. No words were yelled. Instead Persephone simply lay a freshly scented garment at the end of Melione\"s bed. If Melione looked close enough she would\"ve noticed something hidden within the fabric. Instead she\"d stared so hotly and accusingly almost as if she expected to find Asterion to crawl out of Persephone\"s skull. Unharmed. Grinning awkwardly to accommodate his muzzle. No such thing happened. \"What has father done with him? Why have you shut me away? When can I see him?' Melione could\"ve repeated the questions until she was blue in the face. All Persephone did was linger, staring first towards her feet then back to Melione. When she first found her daughter, seen her shaking, sobbing like a heart broken widow. Of course she ran to her. Held her so tightly, terrified that it was another cruel trick. Stepping towards her daughters bed with caution, as if she expected her to flee like a new born lamb. Persephone perched on the edge of the thick bed, head bowed hoping to hide away her emotions. But, Melione was her fathers daughter. Nothing could be hidden from them. \"Your ... Your father sent him to Tartarus.\" Persephone could feel the air growing thick with hatred. Rising a hand sharply, preventing any curses, or angry pleas being shouted, she finally rose her head looking Melione in the eye. \"Minos played a huge part in it. Melione. You must understand, your father was stricken with grief after you were taken from us. We both were.\" Melione said nothing; it wasn\"t because of her mothers hand. Instead she slowly rose up, stretching her hand to stroke the clothing which lay across the back of the chair. Fighting back angry tears, not wanting to weep in front of her mother, she turned sharply eyes narrowed. \"Tell me, everything.\" A few moments earlier Minos was by no means welcomed with open arms. A silent fog of fear surrounded the powerful lord of the dead. For a split second, Minos was tempted to fall at Hades feet. It sickened him. This god was able to do what took the death of his son, for him to complete. Instead of hearing a deathly whisper of words, a more disturbing sound of flapping came from thick shadows. A creature with the body of a malnourished bird, but facial features resembling a withered old hag, flew ungracefully to perch just below Hades bent knee. Minos was sure he heard bones cracking beneath oil coloured wings. It starred down at Minos like he was no more than a fat worm. Hades said nothing. Instead, dragging his fingers through a mixture of oily hair and feathers, he carefully took a small scroll from its withered mouth. There were no golden words, spelling Minos\"s name in brilliance. Only ashes. Peering over her husbands shoulder, Persephone felt bile burn her throat. Inhumane acts, seemed to almost mock the readers. All that went through Persephone\"s mind was Melione. Their precious daughter lost in this mad mans view of justice. What little colour was left within her husbands eyes, soon became lost. He didn\"t conjure up ashes, soot; not even fire. \"Hades...\" Rising his hand, silencing Persephone, Hades produced a fake \"awe\" of calm. But Persephone knew better. The bident to his right almost seemed to grow; like a loyal hound. Minos\"s tongue. His vile, slippery serpent tongue, sung songs. Praises. Tears pricked at the corner of her eyes. Hades however remained just as still. Never moving. Turning her almost fearful gaze back towards Minos, she saw the gleam glowing around his shadowed form. He truly thought, he was winning over Hades. Clouding his judgement. Persephone barely swallowed down an inappropriate laugh. Taking a cautious step forward, Minos lathered his lips. Persephone\"s palm turned into a fist, as his amused gaze focused on her. How she wished she could claw out his eyes. Waving his ash coloured hand, Minos licked his lips followed by a quick swallow, so as not to stutter when he pleaded his case. Like a snake changing its skin. \"My lord. I come to you, to please see mercy upon my humble form. The man who will soon follow me, is not to be trusted. It is him, who took your daughter. Terrified her for weeks on end. Through my bravery I managed to save her. I wanted to bring her to you. To reunite you both..\" Persephone\"s eyes narrowed in hatred. Surely he could hear himself speak. Persephone was no fool, she\"d heard the threat which had been placed on his head, by a young woman wearing an ebony necklace. This pathetic excuse of a man was the true monster. Still though he continued to speak, describing himself as a true hero. How many poor murdered souls had been brought to them, driven here by his hand. \"Don\"t listen to him Hades. Send him away, he\"s the real monster.' Persephone began to mentally plead, as she glanced towards Hades who sat stiller than a statue. Almost as if he could read her thoughts, Hades spoke in a deep whispered tone. \"Persephone, see to Melione.\" Looking up in shock, hands gripping hold of the thrones arm rests to prevent her body from trembling. \"Hades...?\" Turning towards her, eyes shadowed, mouth in a fixed in a narrow line. He repeated himself more forcefully. Persephone continued to look at him in astonishment. \"Please..\" No one else would\"ve noticed the change in tone, or the small twinkle within his eye. Despite endless hours of torture, from being separated from their daughter, the wool hadn\"t been pulled over his eyes. But there was something else, something which made Persephone fear for the outcome. Letting out a shaky breath, Persephone nodded her head before slowly rising from her throne. The two judges who stood to the side, also rose in respect. Sparing a less than pleased glance towards Minos, she noticed his lack of respect. \"If only I could throw you into the lava\"s river.' Descending down the stairs, head held high, Persephone left the throne room. Back in Melione\"s room \"I don\"t know what else they spoke of. But from what I heard of Minos, I can\"t say its anything pleasant.\" Stretching out her hand, Persephone moved aside the fabric of clothing, exposing a smooth surface. Melione pushed herself up slightly, brow creased. \"Is that...\" \"A hand mirror. Yes. Only this one isn\"t for doing your hair.\" Handing the mirror over, Melione took with care, looking up with bewilderment towards her mother, who\"s response was an understanding smile. \"Say his name.\" Narrowing her eyes, looking down at her own angered expression Melione wanted to throw it across the room. How was this supposed to make anything better? Persephone however was persistent. Letting out an annoyed sigh, her fingers tightening around the edge, Melione finally whispered the name which only a few hours ago had caused her heart to slice in two. \"Asterion.\" For a second nothing happened, then a blue mist began to swirl within the mirror, as it faded it showed the terrifying image of Tartarus. The image began to move sharply, ignoring wailing souls even Tantalus who still couldn\"t reach the engorged apple hanging mockingly above his head. Finally it came to a stop. The image became slightly blurred as it tried to make out the person, wondering around. A pale hand slipped out from beneath the cloak, dragging its self across scratch covered walls. Melione\"s eyes narrowed as she looked closer. This couldn\"t be Asterion. Where was his fur, horns even his muzzle... Persephone who had moved herself to the other side of the room, standing by the bedroom door, cleared her throat, forcing Melione\"s eyes to roll up. \"It is him Melione. Your heart surely knows this. I can\"t take you to him, but there is someone who can.\" Before Melione could question what her mother was up to, Persephone opened the door smoothly, revealing one of the judges. \"Aiakos...\" He bowed in greeting, a neutral expression on his aging lips. There was no small talk between the trio. \"Princess, my Queen. We must leave now, I\"m afraid things are starting to take a turn for the worst.\" Rising swiftly from her bed, not failing to miss the guilty expression which clouded her mothers features. Melione opened her mouth to demand an explanation, but Aiakos stood between them. \"I\"m sorry but there is no time. If you want to free him, we must go. Now!\" It wasn\"t a pleasant departure, Melione barely said two words to her mother, furious that her take on the story of what happened in the throne room was a lie. Persephone walked with them towards the stables, where a golden horse with an ebony mane, legs and muzzle stood waiting for Melione. If this was any other adventure, Melione would\"ve grinned from ear to ear. Arion was his name, a birthday present from her uncle. Instead she mounted swiftly without so much of a smile. Persephone and Aiakos shared a quick word, before the judge turned towards her. Melione wasn\"t sure, but she thought she saw disappointment in his eyes. Was it aimed towards her? She didn\"t care. Her mother deserved what she got. \"Be careful...\" Persephone whispered, as Aiakos joined Persephone\"s side, and they walked down the path towards the blackened gates of Tartarus. As Aiakos led them through, Melione barely noticed the guards standing within the endless shadows surrounding, Tartarus\"s gaping mouth. Only their weapons could be seen glinting, like brave stars beneath a full moon. Keeping her head down on Aiakos\"s orders, they slipped through without any trouble. As the gates closed behind them, Melione had to gain control over her breathing. Despite her both right, those who wondered within these walls, lacked the better sense of judgement and care for such labels. Melione owed Aiakos her life. As her fathers most trusted judge, he was putting his life on the line, all for a man he didn\"t even know. In-bedding her hands deeper into her steeds ebony mane, fingers already feeling sore and blistered. The air around them had long since lost the familiar scent of home. Aiakos led her through over grown paths, Melione didn\"t linger long enough to find out what sort of roots were scattered across the stones. On more than one occasion, Melione dismounted. It took both herself and Aiakos to convince Astrion\"s nimble hooves to climb further rough terrain. Melione\"s back ached. Aiakos however never complained. He always kept two steps ahead, ever watchful for anything less charming than her fathers loyal guard dog. Oh, how she wished they could\"ve brought Cerberus with them. Just as Melione mounted Astrion, an uneasy shiver trickled down her spine. Looking around sharply causing Astrion to lazily spoke to the side, Melione realised she had every right to be concerned. Blood red eyes peered through cracks, around stones. Even above their quivering heads. One was brave enough to peer out of the darkest shadow. Melione leaned across Astrion\"s neck, keeping a firmer hold of his reins in case he bolted. Melione couldn\"t be sure but she swore she saw the head change shape, from a jackal to a hound and then... Aiakos placed a firm but gentle hand on her shoulder, pulling her back into the saddle. As she looked down at him, he kept his eyes forward. His face an expressionless mask. \"Don\"t look at them. They\"ll penetrate you with false fear, blinding you from what is really important.\" Taking hold of the reins, Aiakos tugged Astrion on sharply, forcing them away. Melione tugged at her hood, not trusting herself not to look back. Despite Aiakos\"s warning, when she had looked at those eyes it almost felt as if they were pulling towards them. Giving them her every wish she desired. She resented and admired Aiakos at that moment. They walked on for another half an hour, before Melione finally had control of Astrion. Their shadows stretched across the south walls. A lava stream, bubbled and growled beside them. There was no friendly boat driver to be found here. Licking her lips nervously, Melione quickly bowed her head. A few unfortunate inhabitants were wondering around, their faces shallow, eyes filled with so much anger and hate. Even Aiakos placed himself closer to her side, trying to conceal himself. Just how many people how he judged to be sent down to these pits? Shuddering at such a thought, Melione held her breath until the last shadow finally passed them.", "Jake pushed off the Red Bull. \"Fine,\" he breathed against the mouth guard. His right side ached. His opponent had hit him right in that tender spot in the ribs. He needed to focus. Needed to kick this guy\"s ass so he could prove himself to Ryan. Back in the match he dodged several attacks and didn\"t bother to hit back. He was looking, scanning for a weakness. It was what the new guy in Brazil taught him. When they get you down, let \"em think they own it. Let \"em go all out. You take it easy and just watch. Find where they\"re trippin\" up and kill \"em. He moved his head to the right and raised his left arm to counter a kick. There! When the guy roundhouse kicks with his right, he drops his left arm too low. Too low to block. He stalks around, waiting for the next opportunity. \"Don\"t back down, Tyler.\" A voice calls from the crowd. Ryan\"s voice. The guy powers up a kick and strikes. Jake\"s left arm shoots up to counter again, but then simultaneously he swings his right arm and pitches forward, twisting his torso to maximize the force of the punch. Direct hit. He feels the air leave his opponent in a rush as he falters and clutches his side. It\"s over rather quickly after that. Ryan touches his right side and even though Jake winces a little at the touch, he\"s still flushing from feeling Ryan\"s fingertips ghosting over his skin. \"Rib\"s not broken this time. Guy doesn\"t hit so hard?\" Jake laughs, \"no one hits like you,\" then pauses for dramatic effect while producing a smirk of his own, \"you hit like an asshole.\" Ryan smirks and smacks Jake upside the head. \"You love me, though.\" Jake freezes. And there it is. There is that truth staring him in the face. Ryan just realizes what he said and his forehead is bunching up again. But when Jake looks up at him, it\"s with a crystal clear sincerity that he murmurs, \"yeah, I do.\" He cancels his plans to go back to Florida. Ryan is taking an intensive acting seminar over the break and Jake doesn\"t hesitate to agree when the other asks him to stay. His mom is beyond annoyed until he explains it\"s about Ryan. Charlie is miffed that he won\"t be getting a present, until Jake promises him two when he finds time to go home in the spring. One from him and one from Ryan. When Jake finishes his final test at the center in USC, he drives full speed over to UCLA where Ryan and a few friends are sharing an apartment for their last year. Ryan has a couple of days off so he shows Jake around. More adventurous as seniors, they drive along the highway 1 to Santa Barbara, where the gaggles of beautiful women that Ryan and his friends normally hang out with are shocked the minute he introduces them to Jake as his very best friend. Ryan just smiles and smiles, it feels good to have Jake back in his life. They spar on the beach sometimes, drawing crowds of onlookers that every once in awhile display flashes of concern before they realize that the two men are only practicing. Ryan introduces Jake to his krav maga club, and Jake would spend his free time there during the days when Ryan was in his seminar. Many elements of krav were already familiar to him, but admittedly he had spent more time on TKD and capoeira, so there were certainly some new tricks to try. The first time they sparred Ryan got Jake on his back with a crazy takedown move and straddled his hips with a smile, \"if you want to be the best...\" he said lazily pointing two fingers at himself and grinning. Jake laughed and pushed him off. They fuck almost every night. Either Jake\"s coming back from the club and his testosterone is running high, or Ryan just nailed a scene and wants to celebrate. It\"s only after one morning when Jay, Ryan\"s suite-mate from freshman year that Jake still somewhat remembers, comments about how paper thin the walls are that the two of them dial down the activities a little bit. When school resumes in January, Jake reluctantly pries himself out of Ryan\"s arms the day of his flight. It\"s 5am and he needs to be at the airport for an early flight. They have sleepy slow sex one last time in the shower before Ryan drives him to the airport. They don\"t say anything the entire time, but this time there\"s no mistaking where they stand when they kiss at the gate. They talk once, maybe twice a week. They\"re both independent adults now. And this, Jake muses one evening, is what he wanted. He wouldn\"t want to be in a relationship where two people are so co-dependent, they hate the other for binding them so close, but they\"re no longer brave enough to try out what freedom feels like. By the end of the semester they\"re fully caught up on the last few years. Both Ryan and Jake laugh about how much they\"ve switched roles. Jake wants to pursue the spectator sport full time, though as he\"s always reminding Ryan, acting may not be very different. Jake was in a fraternity and Ryan was not. Perhaps overly sensitive to the stupid jock stereotype, he got an apartment off-campus with Jay and a few of his other buddies. They\"ve formed their own little clique over the years. To Jake\"s surprise, Ryan only went out with two other people since they broke up, each time ending the relationship in a few months. Jake wonders if Ryan can see the blush through Skype when he mentions that he can\"t remember how many people he\"s gone through. Ryan smirks dryly and Jake protests, \"that\"s what I needed to get over you!\" Ryan tells Jake that he eventually told his parents. His stepmom was actually supportive, but his father found it difficult to react. Ryan shrugs it off. His father was always distant, so this doesn\"t make any difference. Eric knows, and surprisingly took it extremely well (Jake forgets, but he thinks Ryan mentions Eric had a cousin who was gay, or something like that), though none of Ryan\"s other buddies did. Jake mentions Max\"s reaction and Ryan can barely hold back a snort. They both head back to Florida for spring break. When they show up at Jake\"s house, both are warmly welcomed by Jake\"s mom. Charlie, on the other hand, gives Ryan a big hug after Ryan presents a state-of-the-art racket, and then pointedly ignores Jake after he forgot himself to get a present for the kid. Jake is too surprised to say anything but Ryan just smirks and mouths, the best. And while neither want to do the crazy spring break again (Ryan went the year before to Los Cabos and Jake went with his fraternity to Cancun), they do take a roadtrip down to the Keys. Just the two of them. Like Italy, but not like Italy because this time, neither of them are hesitant about anything. The second to last day of break, they\"re back and telling stories of sea turtles and bioluminescent waters over dinner at the local greasy burger joint they all used to frequent in high school. It\"s Ryan, Jake, Baja, Max, Eric, and Rhodes, a guy Ryan knows from UCLA who happens to be visiting some friends of his in Florida. Surprisingly, they all get along. Any beef between Eric and Jake was via Ryan anyways so that wasn\"t a problem. Max finally got over, whatever he was having trouble with, and even though he didn\"t say anything directly to Ryan all night, he at least lost the perpetual death glare. Baja is nice to everyone, and she flat out tells Ryan how much better of a person he is, earning a gawk from Jake and a polite thanks from Ryan. He has a picture of them framed in his bedroom from that night. Years later he\"ll look back and realize it\"s the last picture of him and his friends from high school in one place all together. They\"re still young, still so fresh. And when he graduates, that photograph is the only memento he takes out to the West Coast. \"Watch your back!\" Jake whirls around and barely dodges the fist that comes flying from the guy in red behind him. Then he swivels again and catches a foot from his left. It\"s 5-on-1 at krav at the club and he\"s never felt this level of intensity before. Most fights he\"s been in are 1-on-1, maybe 3-on-1 max. \"Tyler, defense up, all times!\" Ryan yells. Jake gets frustrated and turns a roundhouse kick at the nearest assailant, sending him flying. \"Woah stop!\" Ryan calls out and the other four guys around him back down. \"The hell are you doing, Jake? Fists only!\" \"Fuck off,\" Jake murmurs under his breath, then rudely stalks out of the circle ramming his shoulder into Ryan as he walks by. The blond turns with a frown and watches his partner head off toward the locker room. \"All right guys, free spar, back to it,\" he barks before rolling up his sleeves and walking off himself. Jake has his hands pressed against the shower tiles letting water flow full force down upon him when he hears footsteps come in. He knows it\"s Ryan. \"Jake, buddy, calm down man, what the fuck.\" He doesn\"t say anything, lip curled in defiance. Ryan sighs, \"you know I just want you to be prepped for the test next week. The main man isn\"t going to go any easy on you and I\"m not either. Stop taking it so personally guy.\" He steps into the stream, wraps his arms around that chest he knows so well, and moves to kiss Jake\"s neck but the other turns brusquely. \"I know, I know. It\"s just, I\"m not used to this OK? You playing coach and all. Feels like-\" \"-no man, fucking don\"t say it. This isn\"t high school and The Beatdown. I\"m not the same asshole trying to beat your ass down. I\"m just trying to help you, OK? I\"m not trying to be-\" \"-the best?\" Jake laughs. \"Yeah, you just are.\" \"Jake, don\"t be a bitch about this. There\"s nothing to be jealous of and you know it. So cool the fuck down.\" Ryan says with a glare as he steps out of the shower stall and picks up a towel. When the locker room door slams shut again, Jake closes his eyes. It\"s late when he gets in. Jay looks up from the dining table where he\"s studying for grad school exams and doesn\"t say anything. Jake sighs, dumps his bag on the couch, and heads upstairs where he knows Ryan is probably already in their bed. He pulls off his clothes and crawls under the covers. \"Sorry,\" he whispers as he presses a kiss against Ryan\"s shoulder. \"For what,\" comes the exasperated reply in the night. \"Being a dick,\" Jake admits and scoots closer, wrapping an arm around Ryan\"s firm chest. \"I know I get like this, I\"m just... used to being good, that\"s all.\" Ryan turns so that they\"re face to face. \"Jake, you are good,\" he says softly. \"You\"re better than me already and you know it. The only reason I\"m a level higher at the club is because I\"ve been there longer. The main man sees the potential in you. We all do. And we want you to get far. Crazy far, guy. Me? I want to see you take home the UFC someday championship. And I want to help you get there, be there. You get that?\" \"Yeah,\" Jake sighs. \"Yeah I do.\" After graduation, Jake moved in with Ryan and his friends. Ryan was looking to break into Hollywood and there wasn\"t any other place in the world he could really live. He got himself an agent, took on some headshots, and then started the arduous process of audition after audition. A few small-time roles, mostly because they needed his fighting talent. For Jake, it was an easy decision once he found the perfect trainer. He could train anywhere, Roqua had already said to him that he\"d taught the guy everything he could. If he wanted to go pro, he\"d need some advanced training. And as long as Vitor wanted to live in Brazil, he\"d need to find someone stateside. Turns out, and Ryan didn\"t even know, the guy who headed up the krav maga club used to be a UFC heavyweight champion several years ago. Jake wasn\"t in the same weight class, but still, here was a living, breathing, teaching, and infinitely accessible coach. Joining the club was easy, and with his background and stated intent, Jake knew he could quickly advance and start serious training. But his coach insisted he go through the proper regimen, so he spent a year working his way up the levels. From basics to advanced. On the weekends, Ryan sparred with him, always one level up so he could master the more advanced techniques before everyone else. He also found a local muay thai club and started picking up those skills as well, polishing up his kicks especially against a bunch of wire-thin Asian guys who, despite all appearances, could shatter bone with their feet when they wanted to. But as much as the training was intense and grueling, he found himself constantly pissed off. He was furious the first time the krav guy told him he had to work his way up. Only Ryan whispering in his ear that he\"d help him get there twice as fast kept him calm. Whereas training used to de-stress him, it seemed to be constantly fueling his aggression these days and not even running helped him relax. For his 24th birthday, Ryan took him on a surprise trip. He\"d just landed a small but meaning gig with actual screen time opposite some big names in Hollywood. Not more than a few minutes, but enough that he got to fly his partner to Greece for filming. The two of them laughed and played for two weeks after all the scenes were shot on their own dime. They swam in the Mediterranean, and chased each other in Santorini. Jake felt like a kid again and it physically pained him when he saw the sprawl of LA come into view the night they flew in. More months of training flew by and Jake felt his agitation rise again. He was improving but something felt off. Like he wasn\"t improving fast enough. Or he wasn\"t getting good enough. He kept watching fights on their TV at home and became annoyed the second someone knew a move he didn\"t. \"What the fuck is wrong?\" He demanded one morning as they sparred on the beach. \"What? What? What, Jake?\" Ryan said, throwing up his hands in frustration. \"Why are you doing this? Why are you spazzing out? It takes years to win a championship and you\"re already better than anyone else I know, and you\"re learning faster than anyone at the club, and you\"re getting your private sessions with the coach. What the fuck more do you want?\" \"I don\"t know!\" Jake said, gritting his teeth to keep from screaming. \"Fuck, man.\" Ryan said, \"we can\"t keep doing this. You want to go home?\" \"No,\" Jake panted. A small part of him whispered a caution but the larger part of him shrouded in some kind of unnamed, undefined rage pushed forward. \"Fucking just... attack me!\" \"No,\" Ryan said, crossing his arms. \"Not when you\"re in one of these fucking moods. Calm the fuck down, Tyler!\" Jake growled low in his throat and charged at Ryan, tackling him to the ground before mercilessly striking his torso. Ryan recovered from his surprise in a moment, and started countering. At one point his left foot struck up and pushed Jake\"s heavy body off. He bounced up first and stared at Jake, \"the fuck is wrong with you asshole. You want to get your ass beat? Is that it?\" Not even he believed it, but Ryan had his own rage stirring inside from months of Jake\"s bullshit, and he surged forward, kicking at the brunette repeatedly. Jake dodged and countered a few of the hits but then stumbled in the sand and the next kick sent a jolt of pain up his right side. Damned ribs. He flew into a fury and grabbed the foot that came toward him next and twisted. Ryan yelped and fell back into the sand. They grappled for a bit before both got up again, panting. \"What the fuck, Jake... you\"re losing your mind man, calm the fuck down, I won\"t say it again!\" But Jake was beyond listening. He heaved a few deep breaths and the charged again. Like a bullfighter Ryan narrowly dodged, then used Jake\"s own momentum against him by landing a solid palm strike to his exposed back. Jake crashed into the sand. Ryan\"s mind was whirling. What was happening? He really didn\"t understand. It was as if Jake was unraveling before his eyes. Jake\"s technique was getting sloppy, blinded by his rage, and Ryan just couldn\"t understand where all of this was coming from. Jake bent over the sand, his head between his forearms. The arch of his back rising and falling with every forced breath. \"Jake,\" Ryan called again trying to reason with him, \"come on man, please. Let\"s go home, we can talk later if you want OK? Just, I don\"t know how to help you, and you\"re not letting me.\" I don\"t need your help. Ryan comes closer and Jake\"s mind screams a warning. It\"s too late. Ryan\"s hands are on his arm, and he\"s finds himself being pulled up when he suddenly strikes. The crosscut lands hard and he hears the crack before he sees Ryan fall, ungracefully and without control, hard into the sand. So unlike him. Jake\"s standing and breathing heavily. His eyes are unfocused but some part of him is screaming. Ryan flinches. He hasn\"t felt pain like this in awhile. Not since his Beatdown days. Not since he quit the spectator sport that now has Jake by the balls and won\"t let go. But he remembers what it\"s like. And he takes it. He doesn\"t scream or cry as he cradles his left arm, the one he\"d used to help Jake back up, to his chest. He knows there\"s a fracture somewhere. He stands. \"They just want us to kill each other,\" his face is deadly serious. No smile, no smirk. \"that\"s what you told me once, Tyler. Congratulations.\" He walks off without a second glance behind him, toward his car, which he\"ll take to check himself into the hospital. Then head back to his apartment where he\"ll call in sick for his next audition. Then to his room where he\"ll look at all of Jake\"s stuff, all of their stuff, and wonder where the hell it went wrong. Back on the beach, Jake is closing his eyes. It\"s Tuesday when the plane touches down in Florida. Charlie\"s picking him up from the airport and he doesn\"t say anything. Just grabs the bag off the carousel and heads toward the car, Jake in tow. They make small talk. Charlie is back home from Virginia where he got a full ride for tennis. He remembers talking on the phone with him (he now wants to be called Chuck, and when Jake repeats that with some incredulity, Ryan\"s laughter echoes back all the way from the kitchen). Their mother was so proud, two kids with full rides; she did her job all right. Eventually though, his nosy kid brother is still just that. \"What happened with Ryan?\" \"Charlie-\" he groans. \"-Chuck,\" comes the quick reprimand. Jake rolls his eyes, \"you know I\"m never going to call you that. But I can at least agree to not call you Charlie in public. Deal?\" \"Fine, now stop avoiding the question. What happened with Ryan?\" Jake sighed, \"I happened.\" Roqua told him, that one time when he bit back \"oh, so it\"s my fault?!\", to calm down. Vitor said the same (with a few more colorful flourishes added in the mix). So did the coaches at Columbia. They all said the same really, the message was always there. You have a lot of anger, boy. And it comes out when you train. He never thought anything of it. So he got pissed, big deal. He chalked it up to testosterone. Who doesn\"t get angry when they\"re losing? Look at the fighters on TV, hear the way they talk, they\"re all just a bunch of raging animals. But that\"s something he never wanted to be. He\"d freaked out before. Hit too hard, thrown in some nastier combinations that weren\"t technically allowed. But he\"d never lost so much control. Not like that. He didn\"t go back that night. When he finally cooled off a few hours later, the sun had completely set and it was just him lying on the cold sand in the darkness. He crawled up, grabbed his clothes and walked to the nearest bus station where he sat all night. Mostly with his head in his hands, not falling asleep, but trying to sort out what was the matter with him. Where was all this anger coming from? By the time mid-morning rolled around he caught a bus to the club, thankfully Ryan doesn\"t go until the afternoon, and said he was taking some time off. The coach looked at him with not a hint of surprise and just said, \"come back when you\"re really ready.\" Jake nodded stiffly and left. He knew Ryan had already left the apartment too but Jay would probably be home, studying. When he came in Jay asked him why he looked like total bum. Jake didn\"t reply immediately, just went to his and Ryan\"s room and took a long, hot shower. He came out, packed the few things that he\"d brought with him. Mostly clothes and electronics; Ryan already had the place fully furnished. His hand lingers over the photograph that he brought from home that now sits proudly on the nightstand, but he doesn\"t pick it up. Instead, Jake turns and heads downstairs with his carryon trying to not look at Jay\"s puzzled expression. \"Hey, I\"m going to take-off for a few weeks. Sorry, man, just... something came up.\" He was out the door before Jay had a chance to ask questions. He was embarrassed. He couldn\"t face Ryan again, wouldn\"t; not until he had better answers to give. No more excuses. He wouldn\"t be the weak one in their relationship. He camped out at the airport for a few days waiting for the next cheapest one way back home. Still set him back $400, but could\"ve been a lot worse. He called his mom to say he was coming home for a bit but left the details vague. Charlie immediately knew something was up, so volunteered to pick him up. What a clever kid. \"Hey,\" Jake says grabbing Charlie\"s wrist. \"Don\"t tell mom, OK? I just, I don\"t want her to worry yet.\""]}
{"id": "1ccac2cf-6e6a-51d9-9b62-dc741932b40d", "fandoms": ["Austin & Ally", "Lemonade Mouth"], "pair": ["\"You could take a lesson from this.\" He murmured slyly, stirring at his cocktail as he watched her response from the corner of his eye. Still guzzling she raised an eyebrow as a sign for him to continue. \"Stop drinking.\" There was a small \"pop\" as her lips detached from the bottle. \"The beer?\" \"The coffee.\" There was silence for a moment as she sheepishly smiled, bringing the bottle back to her mouth. \"I was talking too fast again wasn\"t I?\" she murmured into its lip, enjoying the faint whistling sound it made. \"Not really. The dogs outside heard you pretty well at some points. Hey ow! No need for the hitting.\" \"Shut up.\" \"Take your own advice.\" They drank in silence for a while, listening to the bar chatter around them, lost in their own thoughts before he sighed and turned to face her properly. \"But seriously Als, lay off the coffee for a while. Every time I see you, you seem more wound up than a cat during a thunderstorm.\" He stated, ignoring the way she grinned at his comparison. It was quickly replaced with a stressful frown as she set her drink back on the bar, parting her lips as if she wanted to say something, but wasn\"t sure how. He crunched on the ice from his own drink as he waited patiently, knowing she\"d get there in the end. She hadn\"t had too much alcohol to really affect her just yet. \"Do I really seem that caffeinated?\" she whispered at long last, making him snort thoughtfully. \"You\"ve always been rather been a tad hyper, but with the way things have been going, you\"re starting to reach my standards.\" He smiled as she cringed. \"I knew I shouldn\"t have ordered that black coffee. But it was so damn good...\" she muttered exasperatedly, picking at the label on her nearly empty bottle in front of her. Trying not to eye her actions, he chose to take another sip of his drink before realising it was empty. Signalling for another, he turned to see the growing pile of shredded paper in front of her and tried to keep his cool. \"H-hey Ally...I know I asked you this last week, but...are you sure you aren\"t stressed?\" he suggested weakly, knowing he was treading dangerous territory. He accepted his new girly, but delicious tasting cocktail from the bartender as he waited for her response, only to be pleasantly surprised when she shrugged tiredly. \"It\"s ok Austin, I\"m not going to hit you.\" She muttered, still picking, \"It\"s just...with all this work, and the conventions, I\"m facing a lot of overtime at the moment, that I\"m glad that it\"s only coffee I\"ve turned to, to get me through this. Ya know?\" He hummed in response, trying to fight down the weird feeling in his stomach. Tipping her head back to look at the ceiling, she stared at something he couldn\"t see (maybe it was the vomit shaped stain above them...) as she continued to unload her feelings on him. \"Everyone expects too much from me. I know I\"ve been at the company for a while now, but honestly, can\"t they get off their own fat butts and do something for themselves for a change? \"Ally, can you get me those files from the Roberstons?' \"Ally, be a dear and handle this case for me?' \"Ally, baby, you know I love you, but you also know that I can\"t remain cooped up here in Miami with you all my life.' Stupid asses.\" She growled bitterly, sculling down the rest of her drink. He could only sit there and stare at her in shock as the bar tender placed another one on the bar. \"He left you?\" he said in disbelief. She nodded. \"When?\" \"Saturday. Good riddance.\" No wonder she was peeling that bottle label like crazy. \"Why didn\"t you tell me Als?\" \"Thought we had already established that Austin, I was busy. But enough about me. How\"s your week been? Surely you\"ve got a story to tell me since last week.\" She huffed, closing off the topic. He mimicked her careless shrug as nothing really came to mind. \"Not really. Sold a few more albums, tried to write a few more songs, the usual. Honestly, I feel like I need an addiction to bring some excitement back into my life.\" \"Don\"t,\" she gasped, eyes widening slightly in fear, which he quickly eased with a small smile. \"Joking Als, joking. I\"m not going down that path. Not after...\" he trailed off, both of them remembering their fallen friend. Out of habit, they both raised their drinks to the ceiling before bringing them down to clink together, murmurs of \"Dez\" on their lips. As they swallowed their liquor an old tune floated from the bar speakers, a favourite of Team Austin\"s from way back in the day. Taking it as a sign, Austin set down his drink before turning to extend an inviting hand to his companion. She wordlessly accepted it, allowing him to lead her to the dance floor. Tangling his fingers with hers, he rested his spare hand on her waist as her\"s travelled to his bicep. They started to sway, ignoring the other patrons of the small establishment, lost in their stressful bliss. \"I hate how we only meet up once a week.\" She murmured suddenly, voicing what he had been feeling for months. \"Me too.\" \"But with work, and separate lives and...everything, there just didn\"t seem time for Austin and Ally time anymore.\" She continued, shuffling closer so she could rest her head against his chest. He hummed lightly along with the tune and in agreement, bring their extend arms in to tuck against their sides. \"And after Chris dumped my ass, I desperately wanted to call you, but I had no idea where you were. And with Trish still AWOL after...well, I just settled for letting it brew up I guess.\" \"You should have called Ally. I would have hurried right over.\" \"I know, I just...I guess a part of me wanted to keep to traditions and unload everything in another drunken rant. Plus, I wasn\"t a pleasant sight to behold that night.\" He chuckled at her unintentional rhyme and kissed the top of her head affectionately. \"You\"re always a sight Ally.\" \"I don\"t know whether to be happy or offended by that. So I\"m going to go with both.\" He debated over something for a while as they continued to dance, not noticing when the song changed. She must have sensed it cause she pulled back slightly to look up at him questioningly. \"You\"re very quiet tonight. What\"s up?\" \"My label wants me to transfer-\" \"Again?\" \"-And I\"m actually considering it.\" She stopped abruptly, staring at him in shock. \"I feel like Miami is...what\"s that smart word?\" \"Lacklustre?\" \"Lacklustre after all these years, and I need a change of pace. Moving to LA or New York even could be what I need.\" She was silent for a moment, taking it all in with consideration, which he appreciated. Her response though was definitely not what he expected. \"Let\"s go on a road trip.\" It was his turn to look shocked. \"What?\" \"Let\"s go travelling!\" She whispered, her eyes gleaming excitedly, \"Get away from work, breakups, and all this...stress, and just relax. You. Me. The open road. Seeing America. Regaining all that Austin and Ally time we\"ve missed out on since high school. What do you think?\" \"I think you\"ve had more to drink that I realised.\" \"No. I\"m still sober...ish. But think about it Austin! I\"ve always wanted to travel Route 66, and why not now? I think we\"re both deserving of a vacation. Especially before everything hits the fan.\" \"Hasn\"t it already?\" \"Nah, I think a shit storm is making its way up the East coast. So, what do you think?\" He stood there, taking it all in. Here was his boringly sensible best friend, still dressed in her coffee stained black work dress, cheeks rosy from excitement and alcohol as she grinned at him, having spurted out the craziest idea he had ever heard. And he was seriously considering it. Eyeing her critically, he tried to think around the vodka in his system before replying. \"I\"d have to check with work-\" \"Yes!\" she shrieked happily, launching herself against him. \"Yes, yes, yes! Thankyou! You won\"t regret this, I promise! Oh my gosh, we\"re going to have so much fun! Gaaah, this is so exciting!\" Humming in delight she stepped back from their one-sided hug to clutch at his hands, swaying them side to side with her as she danced. Sighing, he couldn\"t help but grin weakly, allowing her to lead. Yup. To say that Ally was boring now was a far cry from the truth. A&A \"Hey Austin, have you seen my black flats?\" Looking up from his phone, he glanced around him quickly before picking up the pair of said shoes from behind his chair. Turning to see his friend\"s butt perked in the air as she checked under her bed he lobbed them at her, the direct hit causing her to squeal. \"Not called for! You could have just said.\" She scolded, rubbing at the spot where she had hit her head on the frame work. He just shrugged and grinned, trying to ignore how attractive she looked when she pouted. They were only half way through their journey, having started in Chicago two weeks ago. They hadn\"t wasted time in planning after their slightly intoxicated decision, and the following Friday their usually occupied seats at Rosie\"s Bar were empty as they flew up North. Now, in the heart of Oklahoma, he was tired, but happy with everything they had seen or done so far. They took turns in driving, with the idea that they\"d get there, when they\"d get there. Their respective works hadn\"t been too pleased with their sudden departures, but were understanding on the subject, putting it down to long subdued grief and stress, which they didn\"t bother to argue. Watching as Ally wriggled into a pair of short shorts, he thought over their friendship and how comfortable they were with each other. She was still insecure and a tad shy as an adult, but around him she didn\"t mind sharing a bed or walking around in only her underwear. In turn, she didn\"t voice any resistance to him doing the same, or if he drank from the milk carton. Possibly cause she shared that bad habit too. But it made him wonder, was he really that deep in the friend zone? From his retrospect, it was quite possible. And he didn\"t exactly have anyone to bounce his wonderments off anymore either. \"Austin? Heeeelllo? Earth to Austin? Sssccch. Huston, we have a problem.\" Ally\"s lame and overly tired joke brought him back, to see her face right up in his, brown doe eyes unblinking as she traced for any sign of life. \"How many times have I told you not to say that?\" \"How many times do you plan to zone out on me?\" \"...Touché.\" Grinning she grabbed his hands, hauling him from his seat eagerly, car keys jingling from around her fingers. \"Come on, we have to get going. There\"s this place I want to see just outside of town, and we\"re losing daylight.\" \"Ally, its only 8am. We\"ve got all day.\" He whined, but allowed her to lead him out of the motel room. \"And why not make the most of it. Besides, didn\"t you want to go somewhere tonight?\" she reminded him, locking the door behind them. He nodded as she absently linked her arm through his, another action that brought back the thoughts from earlier. She had been doing this a lot lately. Whenever they were walking, or sitting down side by side, he would usually feel her small arm wriggle its way around his elbow and rest there for as long as it wanted. She never said anything, so he didn\"t, but he dearly wished she wasn\"t leading him on. Friday nights had been bad enough with trying to keep his control, but being in close proximity 24/7, well, feelings might be unleashed by the end of this trip. \"So, where we going today?\" he asked, trying to shake away his lingering thoughts. She just grinned and tapped the side of her nose, causing him to groan good humouredly. \"Don\"t worry, you\"ll get to sleep in the car.\" She chuckled, clicking the beeper for the car alarm. Two hours later, she woke him up as they crossed the state boarder into Fort Smith. Seeing the city ahead of them, Austin groaned once again, thinking it was going to be another \"Ally Day\", filled with \"fun facts\" and \"amazing sites.' \"Oh shush. It\"s not going to be that bad.\" She giggled, a mischievous look in her eyes. It was for a while. She dragged him from historic site to historic site, gushing madly over each one, as she had done with most of their stops on the road trip so far. But come late afternoon, she surprised him by linking their hands together, and pulling him gently towards a café beside the river. Once seated, she just as gently pried the menu from his hands before pointing her head at a lone man standing behind an open case, a saxophone cradled in his hands. Intrigued, Austin twisted in his seat some more, waiting for him to start playing. He was rewarded for his patience as the most soulful sound rang in his ears, the sax belting out across the river. It wasn\"t long before another man appeared from nearby, crooning to the gathering crowd. \"This is a common occurrence.\" Turning to look back at his best friend, he saw a small glimmer of sadness in her eyes as she watched the duo. \"When Dad took me on one of his many road trip conventions, we ended up here, listening to the locals perform for hours. All the way home, all he could talk about was the Jazz. Days afterwards, I would hear him tinkering about with the brass instruments or the cello as he tried to recreate everything we had heard. It\"s those times that I remember just how passionate he is about music. He doesn\"t show it often, but it\"s the happiest I\"ve ever seen him.\" He was stunned for a moment, before pushing his chair out abruptly, moving it so he could sit side by side with her, linking their arms together. She just smiled and leaned her head against his shoulder. They never did order anything. Just sat there for hours, listening to the talent. A&A Reaching Los Angles wasn\"t as pleasing as they had thought. After all the excitement the last month had given them, the bright lights of the city made him want to turn the car around and head back out to the countryside. Ally seemed to have the same feeling as she rested her hand atop of his on the gearstick, murmuring, \"Do you wish we could just be nomads sometimes?\" To travel and just play music with his best friend at his side had always been his dream. But without the connections of record labels and paparazzi breathing down his neck? Hell, he\"d thought he\"d died and gone to heaven. \"I\"m not looking forward to going home in two days.\" He replied just as quietly, indicating off the interstate and onto a less crowded highway. \"Me neither.\" \"...have you heard anything?\" \"From work? I\"ve got a million messages I don\"t want to touch. From my Dad? Just a couple of \"can\"t wait to see you, hope you had a good trip\"s...\" She paused before inhaling a shaky breath, \"And there was one from Trish.\" He nearly rear ended the car in front of him. \"Seriously!\" \"Yeah. She, just txt me saying that she was safe, and that she had seen the pics of our trip. I dunno if she was talking about on Facebook, or in the magazines, but either way, she contacted me.\" \"It\"s a start.\" Austin mused, not really sure how to state how he was feeling. Ally\"s small hand squeezed his gently in response as she turned back to look out her window. Seeing this, he debated internally for a moment before hurriedly pulling into a side exit, looking out for a way to loop back around. Surprised, Ally glanced at him questioningly, but he just shook his head. \"I can\"t count how many times you\"ve made the executive decision to go on tangent this month, so now it\"s my turn. Just go with it.\" He instructed, signalling back into the traffic going the way they had just come. She frowned but settled back in her seat, letting him drive in peace. A few hours later, around midnight, he pulled up the limestone driveway, pleased to see their destination was as he had remembered. Ally didn\"t need to be awakened as her eyes fluttered open when he shut off the car. Before her was a large farm house, glowing in the moonlight and solar lanterns littering the wide front porch. \"Where...?\" \"My grandma\"s. She\"s out of town at the moment, but when she heard we were heading this way, she said we were welcome to crash here if we wanted.\" He explained with a self-pleased smile. She returned the gesture fondly before looking back out at the house. \"It\"s gorgeous Austin.\" \"Well, come on. Let\"s go inside.\" He said cheerfully, popping open his door. A few minutes later, after hunting for the key in the pot plant soil, and dragging their gear inside, the duo wordlessly succumbed to their weariness and trooped upstairs to the guest bedroom. It wasn\"t long before they were asleep in each other\"s arms. Austin awoke the next morning to see Ally\"s face directly in his once again, watching as he slept. \"A tad creepy, but hello.\" He muttered hoarsely, hoping she couldn\"t feel his morning woody. She hummed before crossing her arms across his chest and propping her head against them, lying half across him, completely unaware of her effect on him as she continued to stare. \"W-what?\" he stuttered, trying to ignore the way her tank top strap was slipping. \"I just realised how in a couple of days I wouldn\"t be able to do this anymore.\" She replied, frowning thoughtfully. \"It made me sad. You\"re fun to watch when sleeping.\" \"I don\"t know whether to be happy or offended by that. So I\"m going to go with both.\" He chuckled, making her grin when she caught the reference. Swatting at his chest lightly, she wriggled onto him further, enjoying his warmth. \"I mean, in a couple of days we\"ll be going back to our boring 9-5 lives. And then...well, you could be moving here. And I\"ll be stuck there.\" She explained, the sadness creeping back into her voice. Lifting his arms to wrap around her waist he propped his head up a bit so he could look at her properly. \"I still haven\"t decided if I\"m going to take them up on their offer just yet Ally.\" \"But you will.\" \"How do-\" \"I know you Austin. I\"ve know you for a good ten years. We aren\"t best friends for nothing.\" She smiled. \"We are aren\"t we?\" he mused, knowing that this topic was broaching a sensitive area. \"Are what?\" \"Best friends.\" His simple response made her stiffen slightly before her shoulders slumped. \"Y-yeah.\" They were silent, both considering whether or not to push the topic further, before Ally sighed and rolled off him and out of bed, hunting for a clean set of clothes. After confirming that it was okay to the use the shower, he watched her leave before slumping back against the mattress, cursing under his breath to himself. He had to settle this. He had to settle it today, before life tore them apart again. A few hours later, after walking around the estate, they were sitting on the front porch, talking mildly and enjoying the day when Austin stopped suddenly and kicked off his shoes. \"Take your shoes off.\" \"Whhh...why?\" \"Just, kick your shoes off.\" He instructed, jumping to his feet. She followed slowly, but not reluctantly, wriggling her toes against the sun worn wood. Taking her into his arms, he began to sway, humming an unfamiliar tune. She was pleasantly surprised and soon relaxed into the notion, resting her head against his broad chest, listening to the vibrations as he sang. \"Singing, hold my loving arms, my loving arms are for you. Hold my loving arms, my loving arms are for you.\" He didn\"t need to say anything else. She simply lifted her head and let him kiss her as they continued to sway, the tune now forgotten. A&A \"So how was work today?\" \"Uggggh. See this stain?\" \"Is that the coffee stain from...?\" \"No. I just got that one out. This, is from the soda he managed to spill today. By \"pure accident\" might I add.\" Chuckling Austin, patted her hand comfortingly before taking a sip of his lime flavoured cocktail. She watched him over the edge of her drink thoughtfully, her question evident on her face. \"Go on, just a-\" \"Why do you drink those?\" \"They taste good.\" \"And beer doesn\"t?\" \"I don\"t want a beer-belly.\" Snorting, she sipped at her favoured drink before swivelling in her stool to look out over their favourite bar. They were silent for a while before she finally broached the elephant in the room. \"I can\"t believe you leave soon.\" \"I\"m only going to be gone for a month.\" \"But that\"s too long.\" She scowled, still not looking at him. \"Am I selfish to say I want you here? Suffering with me?\" He thought about it for a moment before turning in his seat as well, leaning up against the bar. \"...no. No, I think that\"s completely reasonable.\" \"What if you decide to stay there permanently?\" \"Then I\"ll arrange a transfer for you to be at my side...that\"s, only if you want to be.\" He suggested, suddenly unsure. One corner of her mouth slopped upwards slightly as she began to pick at the beer label again. \"Ok.\" A million things in that question was suddenly answered, nearly a month after their holiday. Picking up her hand to kiss her knuckles, he jumped down from his seat before tugging her lightly towards the dance floor. She smiled shyly in return, answering his unspoken question, her old black work dress fluttering around her knees. Pulling her towards him he rested his chin against her head as she tucked herself in against his chest, tangling their hands together. Squirreled away from the madness of their day to day lives and the city, they swayed in their favourite haunt, humming the same tune under their breaths. \"Singing, hold my loving arms, my loving arms are for you. Hold my loving arms, my loving arms are for you.\"", "NB: Hey guys...so yeah, it\"s been awhile since I updating this story. But now that I\"ve rewatched Lemonade Mouth my inspiration is back and the story line for this is complete. So, hopefully there\"ll be more regular updates. August 13th 2011 I don\"t really remember much after Stella\"s encounter. One minute I\"m holding her tiny, shaking frame, the next we\"re sitting on my front porch, blinking in the early light as Mum drops her suitcase and comes running up to us. Apparently we looked a sight. Stella still had deceased squirrel decorated Chucks, and I wasn\"t parting with the gnome. We were tousled haired, pale and I do remember the taste of stale vomit around my lips. There were a few phone calls, a lot of cups of tea and enough questions to fill the silence we were giving. It wasn\"t until we were both tucked away in my bed, covers up to our chins despite the heat, did Stell finally let out a deep, shaky breath. \"Oh my God...Charlie...\" she whispered, turning her head to look at me. Staring at the ceiling, I reached across the mattress for her hand, feeling unable to speak myself. \"What was that? Is...is that really what you and the boys saw? Is that why you guys have been paranoid freaks? Oh god, stupid question Stella. Of course that\"s what it was...what was that?\" \"...I\"m n-\" I broke off, clearing my throat of the sluggish material seemingly clogging it before trying again, \"I\"m not sure. We\"ve been trying to figure that out for the past week. And nothing has come up. I can\"t believe you saw it.\" \"I can\"t believe I talked to it.\" We lay there for a moment, taking it all in before I bolted upright. \"You talked to it!\" \"Charlie, what...?\" she stammered, watching as I fought with the sheets, trying to make it towards my desk. \"Stella, you saw the ghost! You talked to it. And not only that, you recorded it.\" I explained in a rush, tripping over my abandoned desk chair in my haste to grab the camcorder. Fumbling with the power button, I waited impatiently for it to turn on, swivelling the screen out to watch the footage. It took a moment to fast forward to when Stella first appeared, in which she slowly crept out of bed to come stand beside me. \"Whoa, whoa, stop.\" She murmured, as the film jostled. With baited breath I started the video again, my heart pounding uncomfortably in my ribcage. \"...you\"re so paranoid, you\"ll want to know where I am at all times, right? Awesome. Now, how about we check upstairs? From what I can tell, no one really has made it up there. Oh! Maybe that hobo is around. He can give me the grand tour.\" \"If it is a hobo, are you carrying pepper spray?\" \"Do you think pepper spray would have worked?\" she mused beside me, causing me to elbow her roughly. \"Ow, just trying to break the tension here. Skip forward a bit...stop.\" \"...Maybe I should take it outside and bury it. It deserves that much at least.\" \"I\"m not touching that.\" \"Dude, you\"re not even here. Why would you-\" \"Too far.\" Just as it did on film, her breath hitched. I reached for her hand again, squeezing her fingers reassuringly as she muttered my name. I could hear my own panicked murmurs in the background before the sound of a chair crashing to the ground as I bolted from my room. \"H-Hey ghost...man? What do you mean I\"ve gone too far?\" The ghost stared at the camera blankly, flickering like a grainy image. Stella couldn\"t believe she was actually getting this on tape. Lowering the camcorder as if to test her eyes, she blinked at the person in front of her, before looking back down the camera screen. Yup. There in grey and white. The ghost of the White Crypt. No effects, no props, nothing... \"You went...too far...go back. Back! Find me.\" \"W-what? But...but you\"re here! What\"s there to find?\" The ghost made a strangled kind of noise. A groan, she realised, and an exasperated one at that. \"Arguing. So much arguing....but the deed. Too much to pay. Too much heartache. You went too far.\" She puzzled over this for a moment, wondering where Charlie was. Maybe it was just wishful thinking, but that could have been the door creaking open just then. Oh gods, what if there really was a hobo in here as well? \"Dude, were you really worried about hobos when there was a ghost in front of you?\" \"Shut up and listen!\" \"So much heartache,\" the ghost was muttering again, turning to look at one of the walls, as if gazing out a window. \"She would cry and cry to me each night. And they would argue. It was too much, too much to pay. I had to help.\" \"But why? Why are you haunting this place? Tell me, what happened to you?\" The ghost started, as if realising it still had company. With one last, sad, long look, it reached out to her, whispering its familiar catchphrase, \"Too far. Evil people... Find the rest.\" Before Stella\"s name was shouted in the background. The camera dropped to the ground, catching the glimpse of horror on the ghost\"s face as it pulled away, fading as it muttered, \"Find me.\" Pausing the image, we silently stared at the half formed ghost on screen. After a long, uncomfortable silence, Stella cleared her throat and stepped back. \"Well, that happened.\" I couldn\"t help it. I laughed. She looked at me like I had finally lost it before breaking out a smile herself. \"Oh geez Stell. What a mess we\"ve landed ourselves in.\" I gasped, collapsing on the ground beside my desk, camera still in my hands. She settled down beside me with a hum of agreement. \"I can\"t believe we actually caught it all on tape.\" \"I know. Maybe Scott fiddled with the settings and functions to make sure it\"d appear.\" I murmured, thumbing through the settings as I spoke. A tiny brown hand suddenly gripped onto my wrist, stopping me with a jolt. \"What?!\" \"Scott! Wen! The girls! We, we have to show them this!\" Stella stammered, her eyes frantic. \"I don\"t know about you Charlie, but I feel like my head is going to explode. No wonder we went so catatonic earlier. It\"s too much to process. We need to share this with the others and go through it together. Six brains figuring this out are better than our lazy two...well, one. Combined we\"re pretty much one, useless, petrified brain.\" \"How...uplifting.\" Ignoring my comment she hauled me to my feet, wrestling her phone out of her pocket as she did. I simply set the camera on my desk before turning to pick up my chair, listening as she blabbered out a quick, demanding message to everyone in the band. Sitting down, I reached for the camera again, rewinding the footage so I could watch it again. It still seemed so unreal. A hoax. Maybe I\"d look up and see a camera pointed through the window at me, and Tyron would jump out the bushes, screaming \"Gotcha!' or \"that\"s for trespassing!' But between the still yard and the still shot of the ghost\"s upset face, I knew it was no prank. \"Oh...okay, yep, we\"ll be there soon. Sorry for yelling. Mhm, bye.\" I heard Stella finish her last call before walking back over to me, watching the film over my shoulder. \"Stop watching it. It\"s too damn creepy.\" \"I just want it to all be a hoax.\" She placed a reassuring hand on my shoulder, squeezing it lightly. \"Me too buddy, me too. But for now we have to get our butts over to Liv\"s place. She\"s not well apparently. Nasty flu by the sound of it.\" Sighing I closed the camera and headed out after her, unable to ignore the churning in my gut. I was filled with dread. Something, something, was horribly wrong with this story. \"...Just be quiet around her. She\"s extremely tired and hasn\"t been responding too well to her medicines. She should be resting, but I know there\"s no stopping your little gang.\" Mrs White chuckled as she lead Stella and I towards Olivia\"s room, before frowning as she glanced at us over her shoulder. \"Speaking of sleep, you two look like you\"ve been dragged through hell and back. Do you want me to make you both a warm bowl of tomato soup? Or make up the couches in the den so you can sleep?\" \"You\"re too kind Gram, but no thank you. We\"ll just met with the others then be out of your hair.\" Stella politely refused with a tired, but warm smile. Mrs White smiled sympathetically before pausing to knock on her granddaughter\"s door, interrupting Wen\"s lively tale of some sort. \"Olivia darling, the rest of your friends are here. Do any of you want something to eat or drink?\" A chorus of \"no thanks\" rang around the room, followed by a deep, rattling cough that had us all holding our breath empathically. After one last worried glance, she left the room, closing the door half way behind her. It was then that I finally turned to see Olivia. If I had felt shit before, seeing her I felt guilty for my own self-pity. She was so pale, the veins around her neck and hands a striking blue against her exposed her skin. Her hair was hanging limp around her shoulders, and she was nestled amongst her pillows and blankets, Wen\"s comforting arm draped across her shoulders. She coughed again, before letting out a quick succession of short breaths, wincing. I shuffled nervously in the doorway, unsure as to what to do, but I wanted to help her. She just looked so...helpless. Seeing my look she struggled to smile. \"Summer fevers. Wh-what\"cha going to do?\" she gasped, earning a small, weary smile. \"Um, hey Liv. Sorry to hear about your flu. And sorry in advance guys, but this sombre mood is in for in a sharp decrease.\" Stella finally spoke, shuffling further into the room. Sitting on the edge of the bed, she gathered the others around, explaining as she went. \"So, as you know, the boys have been paranoid about a ghost in the White Crypt for the last week now. I thought they were smoking some serious weed until last night.\" She murmured, rubbing at her eyes tiredly as I started up the camera again. \"I listened in on one of their talks before practice, and found out that Scott had the property under surveillance. So I decided to give Charlie here a fright last night. Liven up his dull guard watch. I got a lot more than I bargained for.\" \"Did you see that hobo again?\" Mohini asked curiously, peering over her arm at the camera I was settling in front of her. \"I wish. I really do.\" She whispered as the footage started rolling. To give them credit, they were all dead quiet while watching. Even after the film stopped and Scott reached out to rewind it to watch it again, they were still silent. For the longest time, no one said anything, as we watched the image of squirrel guts fade to black for a second time. And a third. And again. Finally Wen reached out and snapped the screen back against the body of the camera. \"That\"s enough. So we got proof. Unfortunately that doesn\"t solve anything.\" \"What the hell was that?\" Mohini whispered, lifting her gaze to stare at us in shock. \"That\"s the exact same thing I asked.\" Stella murmured, cradling the camera to her chest carefully. I had never seen her so unsure. None of us had. Without our usual rock, we were a mess. Olivia was twisting her lifeless hair around and around her finger so much I was worried it\"d cut off the circulation. Wen was frowning out the window, absently rubbing circles across her shoulder, every single freckle prominent on his face and neck. Scott was chewing at his lip, blood staining the edge of his mouth. Stella and Mo were huddled together, just staring at the camera. I was suddenly filled with a bucket load of self-loathing. Why did I have to take that shortcut that night? Why couldn\"t I just face Tyron like a man? Why did I have to drag everyone into this? \"Are you children okay in there? You\"ve been awfully quiet for a while now.\" Gram\"s voice broke through the haze of hatred clouding my head, her own poking in through the gap in the doorway. She clicked her tongue in dismay when she saw our current state before shaking her head. \"You all need some soup. You look as if you saw a ghost.\" The cliché line shook the last of the stupor off me. As she disappeared, I jumped to my feet and hurried after her. \"Gram?\" she stopped midway down the hall, looking back at me over her shoulder. \"Thank you. I....just, thank you. For everything.\" She smiled and shooed me away with a flap of her frail hand. \"Go lie down child. I\"ll call you all when the soup\"s ready.\" I smiled in return before slipping back into the room, to find everyone\"s gaze on me. Squaring my shoulders, I snatched the camera from Stella\"s grasp and put it safely away on Olivia\"s desk. \"Right. So first of all, I\"m so sorry guys. If I hadn\"t cut through that property the other night, none of this would be happening right now. But we can\"t turn back time-\" \"As much as I wish we could.\" \"Shhh Wen, Charlie\"s having a dramatic speech.\" \"Shh yourself Mo!\" \"Guys, on a roll here...thank you. Now, as much as I wish I could make this better, I can\"t think of any other way to than by solving this mystery. Yes, mystery. We have proof of a ghost haunting a new construction site. Why? Who were they when they were alive? What happened? When? Who? What with?\" \"Professor Plum, with the candlestick in the kitchen.\" Stella automatically sassed before slapping a surprised hand over her mouth. A wiry grin quirked at my lips as I continued. \"Possibly. But we can\"t be too sure yet. Wen, Scott and I have tried researching the mansion by ourselves these last couple of days, and at the moment, we haven\"t found much out. But I was kinda hoping, that now that you girls have seen the footage, you\"ll be on board with helping us? Olivia\"s good with books, and Mohini you\"re studious. And Stella has connections that I don\"t dare question. Between the three of you, I bet you could dig up far more information than we could.\" There was silence for a moment before Olivia coughed out a reply. \"I-I\"m...on board.\" Mohini hesitated before nodding her consent too. Stella didn\"t need to say anything. I knew she was on board the moment the ghost whispered, \"Find me.\" \"Alright. So, starting tomorrow, we should make a plan on what to do and where to look.\" \"Why tomorrow?\" Wen enquired. \"Dude, I don\"t know about you, but I don\"t think I can focus on much more today. And Olivia looks like she\"s about to collapse due to exhaustion. So does Stella. I think some of Gram\"s soup, and a good day of rest is what we all need after seeing that video.\" \"Yeah, I agree with Charlie. I can honestly tell my Dad now that I won\"t be watching another horror movie for a good, long time.\" Scott sighed, running a ragged hand across his head. \"Come on, let\"s go help Gram with the soup. I could really do with some water as well. Anyone else?\" Fifteen minutes later, Olivia\"s room smelt strongly of tomato soap and stale breaths. Upon her request we opened one of the windows, allowing us all to enjoy the soothing summer breeze. Somehow we managed to turn onto a lighter tone of conversation, talking about how the new school year was only two short weeks away. Wen was the first to leave, groaning about summer homework he still hadn\"t finished. We cooed as he planted a gentle kiss on Olivia\"s pale forehead, happily noting the touch of colour that returned to her cheeks at the contact. Stella left next after a worried phone call from her mother. Scott hurried out after her to her part time job, but Mohini and I stayed, enticing Olivia into games of Go Fish until she fell asleep. Tucking the cards in the tidy pile in her desk draw, Mo tip toed out of the room to meet me in the hall, looking back at our sleeping friend once more before closing the door. \"I\"m worried about her Charlie.\" She whispered as we headed out. \"She really needs to go to the doctors.\" \"Apparently she has already.\" I murmured, \"Gram was telling me and Scott earlier that they were going back again tomorrow afternoon. She\"s worried she picked something up while we were on tour, maybe some weird kind of allergy.\" \"But wouldn\"t that haven shown up straight away?\" \"I dunno. I\"m no doctor. But it could be anything.\" ...Really. If only I had known then. If only I had known when I waved goodbye to Mrs White and Mohini and headed home. If only I had known as I slept throughout the rest of the day and dinner. But when Mum came bursting into my room in the middle of the night, clutching the phone to her chest, tears streaming down her face, the part of me that had known woke up. And it cried. And cried, and cried. The trip to the hospital was awful. I sniffed back more tears and snot in that short fifteen minute drive than I had as a baby. My legs felt like jelly as I stumbled out of the car in my slippers and robe, vaguely flashing back to a mere 24 hours earlier as I had dashed to help another of my troubled friends. We found them huddled together in the lobby, all looking as ridiculous I did, but we didn\"t care about that. All we cared about was open arms, reassuring hugs and crying over our fallen friend. August 18th 2011 I can\"t remember the last time I went to a funeral. Mum says that I attended a few when I was a kid, but you\"d think you\"d remember the tears. Or those hollow, lifeless eyes of the family members and loved ones of the deceased. I had never seen Mrs White look so lost before. Earlier, everyone was crowding around her, offering sympathy and support, but she\"d rather latch onto the photo of Olivia she was carrying around in her hand. Fidgeting with my tie, I looked around the packed church, surprised at how many people had attended. From the looks of it, the crowd spilled out onto the pavement with their grievance cards and floral reefs. How many actually knew Olivia though? Did these people really know that she would be cringing at the sight of her face plastered everywhere and that she\"d be blushing with gratitude and self-consciousness at the touching speeches? Judging by how they casually dabbed at their eyes or nodded solemnly at every \"She loved\" moment, I\"m guessing no. \"Charlie, sit still.\" Stella whispered from my right, nudging me in the ribs. \"I\"m sorry, but it\"s just-\" \"I know, I know. But you have to sit and bear it. We\"ll have a proper farewell for her soon.\" Grumbling I sunk further into the pew, glaring at the man drawling on about our dear friend. I knew we had fans, and I respect them as they respect us, but these people, the ones that barge in and spread false tales about our beloved, cold just shove it. I must have muttered the last bit aloud as the rest of the band suddenly shuffled guilty around me, their support radiating. In my life, I\"ve received two world changing phone calls. Well, maybe three. But that first time, I remember with fondness; my hands starting to shake as Wen shouted at me, abandoning the phone in search of the closest radio remote, Mohini and Stella yelling at me to explain myself, the crackle of static then finally, the pure sound of our first hit song blasting along the airwaves. We celebrated all night, dancing around my house and the street, shouting that we were going to be famous, that we\"re going to the top, and that nothing could stop us. The second life changing phone call came weeks after, saying that our tour was set and booked, but that third one... Funnily enough, my actions were similar. Shaking hands, abandoning the phone, searching and shouting for my family. But there was no celebration this time. Mum hadn\"t even pulled into the car park at the hospital properly before I was tripping out the door, running into the lobby in my pyjama filled glory, straight into the mournful embrace of my friends. When the doctors finally came to tell us we could see the body, it had taken us some time to gather up the courage to walk into that room. Wen refused. I think to this day he hasn\"t seen her. I don\"t think he regrets it though. I do. Seeing her pale, pale corpse on the metal autopsy table, cold and unwelcoming like the real Olivia will haunt me to my final breath. If I was Wen, I\"d rather remember my final look as the one of her ill in bed, but smiling, not that robotic figure. Especially now that they\"ve conducted the autopsy. We had gathered together with Mrs White and her son to hear the final findings. What we had thought had been the flu gone bad had really been a spontaneous pneumothorax, or in layman terms, a collapsed lung. The medical team had informed us that collapsed or punctured lungs could happen at random, sometimes caused by an erupting cyst on the lung, which was the case with Olivia. They tried to assure us that there would have been nothing we could have done to prevent it, but it was that unspoken \"but you could have prevented her death\" that haunted us all. The man was still droning on. People were starting to tire from his speech, so with some successful shuffling, the minister managed to stop him and invite someone else up to speak. None of us had said anything yet, and I think it was because we couldn\"t bear to do it alone. But also, the memories we had with her were exactly that; ours. We shared enough with the press, why should we keep on letting them in? \"No one else?\" I half expected that to be Stella\"s calling. If anyone was going to say something, it\"d be her. Surprisingly, it was Mohini who stepped forward. We watched in stunned, supportive silence as she slowly pulled herself towards the casket, where she paused to stroke it lovingly before turning to face the crowd. With a small cough, she began to speak."]}
{"id": "9cc136dd-97fe-5a0f-816b-acc1dbd5b1e4", "fandoms": ["Boondock Saints", "Walker, Texas Ranger"], "pair": ["\"I take them out when I\"m working. Put them back in when I get home.\" She explained, moving her hand gently up and down Murphy\"s thigh. He shivered gently and looked down at the beautiful blonde next to him, smiling. \"I think it\"s great. Yer shapin\" our future.\" Murphy exclaimed, hitting the edge of the table lightly with his fist. \"Shut up, ya kiss ass.\" Connor sneered playfully. \"You two are like five year olds.\" Mona snickered as their food arrived. Murphy pulled his arm away from Mona and slapped his hands together, rubbing them furiously before both brothers bowed their heads in prayer. Mona also lowered her head, praying silently before placing her napkin on her lap and grabbing her silverware. They ate, mostly in silence with scattered conversations here and there about unimportant shit. Mona set her silverware down and covered her mouth, burping loudly. Her face flushed red in embarrassment. Connor\"s jaw dropped as he stared at her, watching her shift around in the booth nervously. \"That was fuckin\" awesome.\" Connor exclaimed, slamming his hand down on the table. \"I like her!\" He added, leaning over the table, pushing Murphy\"s shoulder gently approvingly. Murphy glanced at Mona out of the corner of his eye, she was smiling, giggling softly as she leaned against him, resting her head on his shoulder as he continued to eat. They left the diner, simultaneously lighting a cigarette as she leaned against the building. \"What are you doing today?\" Mona asked as Murphy walked towards her. He shrugged and puffed on his cigarette, standing in front of her, one of his legs on either side of hers, straddling her as they stood. \"Do you wanna do something?\" She asked, blowing smoke in his face playfully. \"I \"unno. We gotta pick up our friend Romeo in a half hour.\" Murphy explained sadly. He did want to spend time with her, but they hadn\"t seen Romeo since they got out of Hoag and that had been almost a month now. Suddenly, Connor was standing next to them. \"We\"re gon\" fuck with Romeo.\" He stated, grinning proudly. \"We\"re gonna tie yer hands behind yer back and put some duct tape over yer mouth,\" he started. Mona raised an eyebrow at him and then looked at Murphy who just shrugged but looked at his brother to continue. Murphy wasn\"t the one to shoot down a good prank. \"Then, we sit \"er in the back, drive to Romeos and make him think we kidnapped \"er and that we gotta kill \"er and get rid\"a ta body!\" He exclaimed excitedly. Mona stood there, one eyebrow raised, looking rather unenthused. \"That sounds kinda sketchy coming from a guy I just met last night.\" She explained, taking a long drag from her cigarette. Murphy smirked and pressed himself against her, leaning in close to her ear. \"You ain\"t got nothin\" ta worry about.\" He whispered, his warm breath dancing across Mona\"s flesh. She shivered and hooked a finger into his belt loop, looking up at him. \"We don\" hurt the innocent.\" He added, planting a kiss on her forehead before grabbing her hand, pulling her towards the car that was parked just down the street. She sat in the backseat, a piece of duct tape placed against her mouth, her hands bound behind her back. She sat there quietly while Connor drove into one of the worst parts of Boston. \"It\"d be a nice touch if ya turned on tha waterworks.\" Connor said, looking into the rearview mirror. She smirked behind the duct tape and worked on her tears. She thought of putting her dog down, the black lab she had growing up. Tears started to burn her eyes as she remembered her best childhood friend, being shot in a gas station robbery. Tears started to roll down her cheeks and Connor cheered from the front seat. \"That\"s what we\"re talkin\" \"bout!\" Murphy laughed, looking back at her. They stopped as Mona started to sob, blinking the tears out of her eyes as Murphy opened the passenger door, pulling the seat up as a younger looking Mexican man jumped into the backseat with her. \"What the fuck is this!?\" He asked, looking over at her in shock. Connor turned around in the front seat and held his gun to Mona\"s head. \"She\"s been causin\" trouble all over town. Sellin\" drugs to little kids, robbin\" little old ladies while they walk home from the store.\" He explained. \"Held poor Murphy here at gunpoint while he tried to take a piss in tha ally.\" \"So!?\" Romeo cried out, \"We\"ve never kidnapped someone before man, what the fuck, why are we starting with her!?\" He asked, tears filling his eyes. Connor and Murphy looked at each other and shook their heads. \"Pull it together, man!\" They both said at the same time. Romeo rubbed his eyes and sighed loudly, wiping is forehead of sweat as he looked over at Mona. Murphy turned around and grabbed Romeo by the face. \"You ready man!?\" He shouted, shaking his head from side to side. \"Adrenaline rush, in\"nit? Our first kill since prison!\" Romeo\"s eyes filled with tears once again as Murphy slapped him lightly on the cheek. Connor pulled into the boatyard, parking the car and opening his door, pulling his seat forward, grabbing Mona by the arm, dragging her out. Murphy and Romeo both crawled out of the car, following Connor as he lead Mona into an abandoned building and dropped her to her knees. \"Man, this is so fucked up. She\"s a little fucking girl!\" Romeo shouted, pushed Connors shoulders as Mona looked back. Murphy winked at her and ruffled her hair softly. \"Would you fuckin\" calm down!\" Connor screamed at Romeo. \"Just \"nother scum bag off tha street, right?\" He added as he pulled his gun out of his jacket. Murphy followed suit and grabbed his gun from the waistband of his jeans, both of them standing behind her, guns pressed into the back of her head. She heard Romeo whimpering in the background as they started to say their pray. As their prayer came to an end she closed her eyes, in fear that they might actually pull the trigger but instead she heard . \"GOTCHYA!\" Murphy and Connor both shouted at the same time, \"Did ya really think we\"d do that to a pretty lil\" thing like \"er, ya greasy spic!?\" Connor shouted as Murphy knelt down behind Mona, untying her wrists. She pulled her hands in front of her body and rubbed her wrists. Murphy moved around to face her, taking a corner of the duct tape and pulling it off quickly. Mona whimpered as Murphy leaned in for a soft kiss on her lips. She smiled and pulled away. \"I don\"t ever wanna be tied up like that again.\" She whispered to him, nuzzling her nose against his. He chuckled and pecked her lips softly. \"Really? \"Cause I could think of a couple ways we could \"ave fun wit ya tied up like that.\" He winked, stand up. She blushed as he helped her to her feet. Okay! So review and let me know what you guys think. This chapter is pure smut towards the end, so if you\"re easily offended, ya probably shouldn\"t read it. Review review review! It had been about a month since Mona had befriended the MacManus twins, and the trio had become inseparable. She met them at the bar every night after she got out of work for drinks and maybe dinner if she had an appetite. Mona and Murphy had grown closer than she thought they would. He\"d bring her coffee in the morning and drive her to work if he wasn\"t busy. Connor had become the brother she never had, teasing and taunting her whenever he got the chance. \"Where\"da tink yer goin\"?\" Connor asked as she rolled off the pool table, stumbling to her feet with a bottle of whiskey in hand. \"Home.\" She mumbled, her brow furrowed in anger as she wobbled in her heels towards the door, her ankles giving out every other step. Murphy grabbed for her as she jerked her arm away. \"Don\"t fuckin\" touch me.\" She barked at him. The twins looked at each other in disbelief. One moment she was giggling happily, talking about her childhood with her very Catholic parents in upstate New York when all of a sudden her mood took a turn for the worse. Connor raced to the door and stood in front of it, crossing his strong arms across his chest and shook his head. \"We ain\"t lettin\" ya leave like \"dis.\" He stared down at her with his smoldering grey eyes. She took another swig of whiskey and tossed the nearly empty bottle to the floor with a loud crash as the glass shattered. Connor never even flinched. \"I... have things... I need to get there.\" She struggled with her words, her tongue seemed to heavy for her mouth and her eyes had become glassed over. Murphy hadn\"t ever seen her like this and it panged his heart to see her acting so cold. He had grown accustomed to the bubbly, happy kindergarten teacher that walked into the bar every night around six thirty. \"Like what?\" Connor questioned with his eyebrow raised, his arms still crossed over his chest. \"Come see... for yer fuckin\" self.\" Mona hissed. Connor nodded, reaching behind his back and opening the door. \"Sounds like a grand idea! Lass\" first.\" He hummed, stepping out of the door way, motioning for Murphy to grab her before she could reach the stairs, fearful that she might fall and hurt herself. Murphy grabbed her hand and pulled her into him. She tried to dislodge his grip on her hand when her foot slipped, causing her to fall forward. He grabbed her shoulders and pulled her back against his chest. He sighed loudly, lifting her up and carrying her the rest of way down the stairs as she kicked and screamed. \"I can... do it my fucking self!\" Her voice echoed throughout the stairway as Connor slipped past the two and opened the door leading them into the bar. Doc gave the three a worried look as they made their way to the front door. Mona pounded on Murphy\"s chest, kicking her legs so hard one of her heels went flying into the air, landing on the sidewalk a couple feet behind them. Connor grumbled as he ran back to grab it, holding it in his hand as he marched forward. \"Would\"ya quit yer fuckin\" bitchin\"? We\"ll git t\"yer place a \"ole quicker if ya just quit fuckin\" fightin\" \"im.\" Connor shouted, pointing her shoe at her. She piped down, never having been yelled at by Connor before. She silently fumed as they reached her building. Connor dug her keys out of her purse and unlocked the door, taking Mona from Murphy and throwing her over his shoulder. \"Run up, unlock ta door, would\"ya, Murph?\" He asked, tossing him the keys. Murphy nodded and ran ahead, unlocking Mona\"s door as Connor rounded the corner with Mona. He set her down and slapped her on the ass. \"T\"er ya go. Home sweet home.\" He said, watching Mona rub her stinging ass cheek as she walked into her apartment, limping dramatically with just one heel on. The boys followed her into the apartment, shutting the door behind them as Mona began to disrobe, walking down the hall, starting with her blazer. She struggled to get it off as she limped forward, her heel clicking loudly on the hard cement floor. She finally got her jacket off and tossed it on the floor, pulling her hair out of the professional looking bun she had it up in all day. Her pencil skirt clung to her hips as she made her way into the second room. The boys looked at each other as the sound of her clicking heel stopped, the ran in the direction she had gone and found her on her knees in front of a large wooden chest, digging through it frantically. \"What\"er ya lookin\" for, love?\" Murphy asked her softly. She shot him a glare before pulling out a glass object and a baggie. Connor smirked knowingly as she doddered back into the front room where she had set up her living room with the help of two strong men. Murphy chuckled as she finally kicked off her other heel, sending it flying against the wall, hitting the floor with a loud thud as she sat on the floor, crossing her legs. She opened the baggie as the boys made their way towards her, sitting on the couch opposite of the coffee table she was sitting in front of. She dumped the bag of weed onto the table and began filling the bowl of her bong, careful as to not drop any. She grabbed her lighter off the table and pulled the bong to her mouth, lighting the bowl, sucking in slowly as she pulled the lighter away, removing the stem and inhaling deeply. She held her breath, looking at the boys for a moment before she exhaled. \"Who\"s next?\" She asked. Connor raised his hand and smirked at Murphy, reaching out for the bong. \"I feel like I\"m in fuckin\" high school again.\" He teased, elbowing his twin hard in the side before mocking Mona\"s actions. Coughing loudly as he exhaled. \"Pussy.\" Murphy snickered, taking the bong from him. Mona and the twins lay on the floor with their heads touching, legs stretched out, smoking cigarettes as they talked quietly. \"What got ya so upset back at ta bar?\" Murphy raised the question about her sudden mood changed. She sighed, feeling much better since the smoke session the three had only a couple minutes before. Her mind was at ease, as was her body as she wriggled against the cold pavement underneath her. \"I just hate talkin\" about New York.\" She sighed, running one hand through her hair as she reached over, taking the cigarette from between Connor\"s lips. \"Aye.\" He murmured, his eyes closed as he listened to her voice dance around in his head. \"My best friend got shot there.\" She started to explain, rolling over on to her stomach. The boys followed suit and propped themselves up on their elbows. They watched her intently as she took a drag from Connor\"s cigarette before placing it back between his lips. \"And when I say best friend I mean it, like together everyday, all day long, no matter what.\" She smiled as she spoke, the good memories of them together flooded her head. She looked at the two grown men in front of her. She couldn\"t help but picture the two in her kindergarten glass during story time. Connor had both fists tucked under his chin while Murphy twirled his pocket knife between his fingers, both of them staring at her intently. \"The summer we turned thirteen, he went to the corner store to get a pack of fuckin\" gum...\" She felt her throat grow tight, her eyes filling with tears as she remembered the police cars pulling up in front of his house. His mother falling to her knees as the policemen broke the new to his parents. \"Some fucker shot him during while robbing the store.\" She finished, choking back a sob, holding her head in her hands as she tried to regain her composure. \"T\"irteen?\" Connor whispered, shaking his head. \"What\"ta sick fuck.\" He growled, rolling onto his back again, lighting another cigarette. \"We know what it\"s like losin\" a friend.\" Murphy cooed softly, rubbing one hand along her back, the comforting gesture made her feel better as she wiped her eyes, looking up at the twins. \"Our buddy Rocco, he was shot too.\" He chewed at his bottom lip. Mona sighed loudly as she pulled her knees up, grunting as she stood pushed herself into a standing position, yawning loudly. \"I\"m goin\" to bed.\" Mona mumbles softly, sleepily rubbing her eyes. Murphy pulls himself to a standing position, wrapping his arms around her waist from behind, resting his chin on her shoulder as he slowly begins to sway her back and forth gently. \"Min\" sleepin\" on ta couch?\" Murphy asked his brother, who was now half asleep on the floor, a cigarette burning between his lips. Mona chuckled and turned her head to the side with intent on kissing Murphy\"s cheek but he tilted his head and caught her lips with his, smirking as he stared into her eyes. \"I\"ll get him blankets.\" Mona mumbles against his mouth, reluctantly pulling herself away from his embrace. Murphy removes the cigarette from between his brothers lips, putting it out in the ashtray that sat next to his head. Connor mumbled something inaudible, rolling onto his stomach, curling his hands under his cheek. \"C\"mon ya big baby.\" Murphy grunted, lifting Connor up by the waist, dragging him towards the couch. Connor had always been a heavy sleeper, snoring so loudly in their younger years poor Murphy would have to wear ear plugs just to sleep at night. Now, he\"s grown accustomed to hearing it, actually sleeping worse if his brother\"s snoring doesn\"t fill the room. Mona entered the room with a large pink comforter in her arms. She tossed it to Murphy who draped it over his brother, who he had managed to move to the couch. His was snoring softly, but Murph chuckled, knowing that it would grow louder and louder with each passing minute. \"May ta blessin\" of ta light be on ya-\" Murphy whispered into her, his lips pressed softly against her skin as he traced circles along her stomach with his fingertip, his calloused skin; rough and hard against her soft, milky flesh. \"light wit\"out an\" light wit\"in. May ta blessed sunshine shine on ya, and warm yer heart \"till it glows like a great peat fire.\" His warm breath danced across her neck, sending shivers down her spine. \"What is that?\" She asked, twirling his hair in her finger, turning her head to look at him, the moonlight shining through the window, illuminating their faces as they lay naked together in her bed, wrapped up in her blankets. \"An ol\" Celtic blessing.\" He pressed the tip of his nose to her temple, rubbing it back and forth against her as he inhaled softly, \"Makes me tink o\"you.\" His voice was low and husky, filled with lust and want. Mona\"s breath hitched as she felt his fingers move south. He propped himself up on one elbow, half laying next to her, half hovering over her as his hand continued it\"s journey towards her nether region. \"I wanted ta do \"dis ta ya since the first night I laid eyes on ya.\" He purred in her ear, making the hairs on the back of her neck stand up straight. \"Please.\" She whimpered, his fingers lingering her silky, already soaking lips. She twisted her hips upwards for some kind of response but instead he pulled his hand away, smirking down at her as she blinked her eyes open. \"Ah-ah-ah.\" He said, wagging his finger in her face as if to scold her. She jutted out her bottom lip like on the first night he walked her home and his heart raced, remembering just how much he had wanted to take her, right there on the sidewalk. \"Keep yer hips down, an\" let me do all ta work, wouldya?\" He demanded, pushing her hips down with his hand. She just nodded, feeling his fingers crawl back down towards her pussy. She tingled in anticipation. Despite everything she had tried, this was the first time her and Murphy had done anything more than kiss. Yes, the kissing had resulted in some \"seat wetting\" and a couple rigid hard-ons. Murphy had always left her wanting more, craving him, needing him until she was almost ready to burst. That had been his plan all along. He\"d tease her with his fingertips while their tongues lashed against each others, his body rocking against hers through their clothing, bucking his hips into hers while she begged him to take her, but he never did. He wanted her to want him until she could barely take it anymore. Her body flushed with heat as he buried his fingers into her suddenly, unexpectedly. She gasped and gripped the back of his head by his hair. He smirked and bent down, taking her right nipple into his mouth. Swirling his tongue around it slowly, teasingly to match the curling and uncurling of his fingers inside her against her g-spot. No man had ever touched her like this before. She was only twenty-four and had been with a hand full of men since her long term college boyfriend, who never really knew how to satisfy her... needs. He growled at her as she started to push her hips up against his hand, the sound of his throaty expulsion sent her into a frenzy, rocking her hips against his palm, his coarse hard worked hand rubbed against her clit. She closed her eyes and let out a small whimper. This whimper drove Murphy crazy. He pushed his fingers into her harder and faster, wanting more moans and whimpers from her. He wanted to see her wriggling around from his fingers, he wanted to hear her beg him for release. He hadn\"t even cared that she was moving her hips against his hand, he needed to hear her beg for him. \"Say ma\" name.\" His voice rumbled in her ear as she panted softly. It took her a moment to register what he had actually said. She looked up at him, her blue eyes sparkling in the dim moonlight, her body rocking against him. \"Murphy...\" She whimpered, sucking the corner of her bottom lip between her teeth. He smirked and rested his forehead against hers as he withdrew his fingers, crawling in between his legs. \"Whattya want?\" He asked, stroking himself as he sat on his knees before her. She sighed at the sight of him, his body hard from working in the meat packing plant. His muscles flexed as he pleasured himself in front of her. \"You.\" She said breathlessly, reaching up to run her fingers across his stomach. He shivered and tensed against her touch, enjoying her warm hands on him. \"\"Ow badly?\" He growled, his eyes locked on to hers like he was hunting prey. He stuck his tongue out of the corner of his mouth like he was concentrating real hard on something. She smirked, wiggling onto her back tossing all the pillows off the bed, looking up at him as she ran her hands down her body. \"I want you so fucking badly.\" She moaned, her fingers finding her molten center, circling her sensitive nub gently. Murphy watched her, blinking in disbelief at the scene unfolding in front of him. \"I want to feel you all over me. I want to hear you grunting while you fuck me like a naughty little girl.\" She teased, pushing her middle finger into her pussy, curling it against her upper wall once before removing it, slowly bringing it to her lips as she gazed up at Murphy.", "malnourishment. The only clothes she\"s wearing barely cover her body. I could count all of her ribs and her fingers, nose, ears, toes and legs are all tinged with blue. She had been out here for a while. But the worst was her eyes. She was scared of us! Utterly terrified! She won\"t look us in the eye, every time we speak she flinches like we will hurt her and she hasn\"t spoken a word yet. This girl has lived through some really rough times. I don\"t even know if we will be able to get her to a hospital.\" After hearing this Walker and Trivetter both looked concerned for the girl and full of rage for whoever did this to her and what she had to have gone through, probably alone. Alex looked like she was going to cry. \"Sydney is talking to her right now but I don\"t think it was going too well.\" \"Well let\"s go find out, but go slowly.\" As the group approached Sydney they could see she was talking to the girl and trying to step towards her but the girl kept backing away. It would have almost seemed humourous had it not been for the look of terror on the girls face. Once the entire group reached Sydney, the girls eyes seemed to get even largeer and the ycould tell she was shaking and trembling in fear. The next thing they knew she had turn around and was attempting to run. But her legs were too weak so she fell and began to crawl away. Walker was the first to reah herr so he reached out and gently touched her shoulder. The girl cried out, curled int oa ball and for the first time spoke. \"Just hurry up, get it over with.\" Her voice was hoarse as thought she hadn\"t spoken for awhile and she seemed ready to accept wahatever it was she expected. \"OH God! I am sorry! I spoke out of turn, Oh God, never again, I swear!\" The Rangers and Alex all seemed shocked at this outburst, not only the voice and words but the clear fright behind the words. \"No,no. It is Ok. We won\"t hurt you, we\"re Rangers.\" Walker received no reply only a stare filled with fear. More fear than he had ever seen, even in Vietnam, because there at least the men had known they could rely on each other. Here, this girl seemed to be all alone. \"Will you let me pick you up and take you to a hospital to get cleaned up, at least?\" That seemed to scare her even more, she was know trying frantically to get away from the 5 adults. But Walker noticed she kept looking at Sydney, just every now and then and not for very long. \"Syd,\" Walker spoke very softly, no more than a whisper,. \"Syd come here and try to talk to her. I think she may like you. But be careful.\" Walkrr very slowly crept back now, never moving quickly and never standing up. Sydney crept forward until she was right in front of the trembling girl. \"It will be Ok\" She softly whispered, \"You can trust us, we won\"t hurt you.\" At that the girl started to shake even harder and began to cry softly. Sydney was confused by this. She didn\"t know what had happened or how to continue. But she tried. \"Would you like me to take you to the hospital?\" A frantic shaking of the head was all the answer she got. \"I am sorry but we have to. Your skin is blue from cold and you are injured. So how about just I take you?\" Suddenly the girl tried to jump up, pressumably to run away, but instead she slipped on the wet leaves, fell and hit her head on one of the rocks. Sydney immediately checked to see if she was ok and was relieved to find a pulse, albeit very weak. \"She is alive. But most likely has a concussion to go with the rest of the injuries now. *We should move her quickly while she is unconcious, luckily the nearest hospital is 5 minutes away it will be faster for us to take her. Gage carry her to the car and we will take her there. But be careful! We don\"t want her to wake up while you are holding her. I have a feeling she really doesn\"t like men.\" \"Got it Syd.\" With that Gage leaned down and carfully lifted up the small girl. \"God Syd, she weighs less than a feather. I bet I could circle her waist with one hand!\" \"Yeah Gage, I know. Let\"s hurry and get her to the hospital.\" Suddenly Walker spoke up. \" Ok you guys take her to the hospital and Trivette and I will start looking through missing person reports.\" \"Walker I am going to go with them.\" \"Why Alex?\" \"Just in case she wants to talk when she wakes up\" By this time they had reached the cars. \"Ok Alex, but keep us updated please?\"\"Sure thing Honey.\" With that the two senior rangers drove away leaving the others to figure out the seating arrangements. \"Gage you drive. Alex why don\"t you sit in the front. I would prefer to sit back here with her in case she wakes up OK?\" \"Yeah Syd. That would probably be best any way. She seem to have connected with you. Or at least more with you than the rest of us.\" So with that figured out they piled in and headed out. *I know, I know. You shouldn\"t move someone when they are injured but for the purpose of the story it was neccessary. I apologize for any spelling or grammar mistakes. I have no spell check so am forced to edit it myself. Also it appears to upload in a weird fashion. Mistakes seen here are not appearing in the original text. I will try to fix this. Ch 3 At the hospital, the girl was immediately rushed into emergency, where it was discovered she was covered with bruises, scratches, deep wounds and many, old scars. Her back, torso, arms, legs and backside, even her ears, were all covered. Indeed the only places that seemed to be without blemish were her face, hands and feet. After tests it was also found she had a concussion, 3 broken ribs, a spearated shoulder and 5 broken toes. Her left arm also showed evidence of a recent spiral fracture, one that could only be recieved by the twisting of an arm by someone very strong. She had obviously been horribly abused for many years. Sydney had stayed with the girl for as long as possible, knowing that if she awoke she would be terrified. Once Syd had to leave she returned to the waiting room where Gage and Alex sat anxiously. She told them what she knew so far, about the extreme external internal injuries. But the doctor was yet to do a vaginal exam to see if she had been raped. Both Gage and Alex were shaken up by what they had heard and Syd had to sit down, she was shaking so hard. \"God Alex, this girl has gone through hell! I honestly don\"t understand how she could have survived. From the looks of things this has been going on for a few years. At least now we can have some idea why she is so scared of us, especially the guys. I would be willing to bet that she has been raped and probably repeatedly. I don\"t know if I could have survived such abuse for such a long time.\" This last remark really frightened Gage, for he knew just how tough his partner was. And for her to admit that she would give in? It had to be worse than imaginable. As Gage was think about Syd\"s comments, the doctor who was treating the girl walk into the room. \"Ranger Sydney Cooke?\" She asked looking around. \"Yes Doctor. How is she?\" \"Maybe we should speak somewhere privately?\" \"Yes of course.\" \"All right. This way please.\" The doctor led them into what appeared to be a lounge, empty. \"Doctor this is my partner Ranger Gage and Tarrant County Assistant District Attorney Alex Cahill-Walker.\" \"Nice to meet you. Well unfortunately the girl woke up halfway through the exam. Upon realizing what was happening she, well, freaked out. Went crazy trying to get out of teh bed. Pulled out her I.V\"s and bruised herself and my nurses pretty badly. I\"m glad you warned us to only have female staff attend her, Ranger Cooke, I shiver to think what would have happened had there been a man present. Anyway, we managed to get her strapped down and at that point she appeared to give up. She just lay there staring at us and silently crying. Actually, come to think of it, she didn\"t make one sound throughout the enire ordeal. Now then I must tell you she has been raped, many times in fact, for quite a few years. There are many, many scars, both internally and externally. She has also been sodomized. We have also called down one of our child psychologists to see if she can help.\" \"Doctor can you possibly tell us how old she might be?\" \"Yes of course. She appears to be around 15 or 16.\" At the looks of surprise on their faces she continued. \"I know she looks younger but that is because she is badly malnourished.\" \"Thank you. May I go and sit with here now?\" \"Certainly Ranger Cooke. But she has been given a sedative to help her sleep. It wasa risk with her concussion but I believe we had to. For her own health, the health of our staff and to prevent other violent outbursts. So she probably won\"t wake up for awhile.\" \"thank you Doctor, for your help.\" \"It was no problem. I must say though, this is the worst case of abuse I have seen in a very long time. I hope you catch the people that did this and punish them.\" \"Don\"t worry doctor we will. Can we have the rape kit please?\" When Sydney spoke she had a firce look on her face. When Gage say this look he knew that this girl would never have to fear her captors again because Sydney would take care of them for her. Gage was also a little frightened however, he had never seen such a look before. Whatever happened in the woods before the rest had arrived had clearly touched Sydney and he knew she would die to protect the girl. He just prayed it wouldn\"t come down to that. Gage didn\"t think he could stand to lose her. \"Of course. But I will warn you there are no semen samples. These people always used condoms.\" \"Ok. Good day doctor.\" \"Good day Rangers, Mrs. Walker.\" \"God Alex. It\"s worse than I thought.\" \"How could anyone do that to a young, innocent girl?\" \"I don\"t know Gage. I just don\"t know. OK, here is what we are going to do. Alex you head back to HQ. Gage take her and fill Walker and Jimmy in on what we have learned. I am going to stay here with her. Maybe when she wakes up I can learn her name.\" Gage agreed but had one stipulation. \"I will be back to stand guard. Don\"t argue Syd. The people that did this are still out there and may find her. I don\"t want anything to happen to her or you Syd.\" His eyes were filled with concern and something else. Sydney felt her heart swell with even more love for him, at this show of emotion. \"All right. You can stand guard. But it has to be out of her line of sight. Got it!? He flashed her one of his smiles that always made her legs go weak. \"Great! I will be back soon. Take care.\" And with a gentle squeeze of her shoulder Gage left with Alex. After they had gone Sydney went to the girl\"s room. The psychologist wouldn\"t be down until the girl had awakened. Sydney sat there waiting for her to wake up, all the while trying to imagine who could do such things to a young girl. In the middle of her thoughts the girl began to fret. Sydney reached out to stroke her arm but that only made her more anxious and scared. So Syd began to sing a gentle lullaby. The girl soon settled down, as though she was remembering better times, maybe with a loving mother. Gage had returned at this point and stood inside the doorway, observing the scene in front of him. His gentle, loving partner trying to comfort a sad, abused girl who trusted no one and abhorred human touch. He thought at that point, that his heart had never been more full with love for his beautiful, caring, passionate Sydney. Ch 4 It was many weeks later and the girl had been released from the hospital into Sydney\"s care. This had been allowed because Sydney was the only person the girl had shown the slightest bit of trust in, and also because Sydney could act as a bodyguard should the need arise. In all this time however the girl had not spoken one word to Sydney, or to anyone else for that matter. Oh she was learning to trust Sydney for she no longer flinched when Syd touched her and had even smiled a couple of times. But she was yet to laugh or even tell Sydney her name. This greatly distressed Sydney so she spoke to the child psychologist whom the girl was seeing everyday. The psychologist, although she could not discuss what happened in the sessions, did confide that the girl would curl up in a ball in a caorner of the room and never move or speak. The psychologist did try to reassure Sydney by telling her that this girl had obviously gone through a horrendous experience that most people couldn\"t dream of, even in their nightmares. It would take months for her to trust people, yet she had already started. She showed signs of trusting Sydney more than any one else. And Sydney should try to encourage this by not pushing her and trying to not get angry or overly upset about anything while near her. At least until the girl realizes that Sydney won\"t hurt her. Sydney thanked the doctor and went into the room. After realizing it was Sydney and not someone else, the girl jumped up and flashed her a brief smile. This was the normal routine and had been for the past few weeks. But then she did something unexpected. The girl came up to Sydney and slipped her hand into Syd\"s, shyly, never looking at her as though she was expecting rejection. Sydney felt hot tears come to her eyes at this show of trust and maybe...affection? \"Come on Sweetie, lets go home.\" Sydney whispered softly. Later on, after supper and after the girl had gone to sleep, Sydney started to think about her. Walker and Trivette still hadn\"t had any luck identifying her. They had widened the search in the past month and were checking with the rest of North America before moving on to international. But with only a description, no name, birthday, date of disappearance or location, it was slow going. Sydney hoped they would be able to identify her soon. The girls wounds had almost healed, just the broken bones hadn\"t, but she still remained skittish as a colt whenever Gage, Walker, Trivette or any man came near. If they were at home and one of the men stopped by she would always run to her room, slam the door shut and not come out till they were gone. Although lately Sydney had been noticing that when Gage came by (and he did almost every night) she wouldn\"t slam her door, just shut it. Maybe, just maybe she was starting to warm up to him. Several nights later Sydney was returning home. It was late at night, almost 11 pm. She had been called out to the HOPE Centre when an abusive husband showed up drunk and demanding his wife. Sydney hated it when a man considered a woman his posession. But the incident had been cleaned up with minimal fuss. The man had, in actuality, passed out shortly after Sydney had arrived, but it was discovered that he had had a gun in his posession so Syd was glad she had gone. And then she had had to stick around for a little bit to help reassure the women and children that nothing bad would happen to them. Sydney hated having had to leave the girl alone; it was the first time, in the 3 months she had been there that Syd had to leave her. And on top of that a horrendous storm had moved in and Sydney wasn\"t sure how the girl would react to the thunder and lightning. So all in all it had been a long night and Sydney just wanted to go home and sleep, after checking on the girl. When Syd arrived she immediately noticed there were no lights on. Her apartment was pitch black, too dark to see in front of her, lit only when a lightning bolt flashed. The second thing she noticed was the sobs and screams, coming from the girls room. These cries were different from the ones heard during her nightly nightmares, much more bloodcurdling, as if someone was actually in the room with her. Sydney rushed to her room, fearing someone was in there but when she opened the door there was no one. At first she thought she was mistaken, maybe the cries came from a different room. But after several flashes of lightning and by following the sounds, Sydney found her. Curled up in a corner with her hands braced against an attack, lay the girl, continuously screaming, \"No! NO! Please stop! I\"ll be good. I\"ll do anything! Please don\"t hurt me again! OH GOD, stop, please!\" She sobbed in between the screams. Sydney felt her heart break as she realized what had happened. The girl had gone to sleep and as usual, when she had a nightmare she had found a corner and curled up. But this time, because of the storm, it was as though the people were there, beating her again. With each clap of thunder she would flinch and cry out in pain, mayhap reliving the abuse. Sydney was unsure of what to do. Should she try to awaken the girl or would that traumatize her even more? Before she could come to a conclusion the girl answered for her with a sudden scream, louder than those before. \"Sydney, help me! Make them stop, PLEASE! Make them stop!\" With such a pitiful cry ringing in her ears and tears pooling in her eyes, Sydney moved over to sit beside her and hold her. At first the girl flinched when Sydney touched her softly but gradually she seemed to recognize Sydney\"s soft, gentle hands and voice. Her eyes opened and as soon as she realized it was Sydney she flew into her lap and arms, sobbing against Syd\"s neck. Sydney held her and rocked her, crying as well, until the tears had stopped. At this point she gathered the girl in her arms, carried her into her room and held her for the rest of the night; which passed without further interruption for the first time. The next morning, when Syd woke she found the girl staring at her with a slight smile on her face. \"Morning Sweetie. Feeling OK?\" With these gentle words, so lovingly spoken, Sydney received a huge surprise. Instead of the usual head shake or nod it was spoken. \"My name is Catriona.....\" TO BE CONTINUED (don\"t you just hate it with people do this!) Ch 5 It had been several weeks since the girl had told Sydney her name. Attempts for more information only met with a frantic shaking of the head and a look of fear. However it did make the Rangers job somewhat easier at finding out who she was and what might have happened. Now all they had to do was look for a report of a missing black-haired, green-eyed, English- speaking, short (5\"2), skinny girl, in between the ages of 14 -17, whose name was Catriona. Doesn\"t sound too hard now does it? They had been working at this for 3 weeks and soon got the break they needed. From Catriona none-the-less. 3 weeks and 4 days after Catriona had told Sydney her name, and 3 months since she had been found, she decided to spill all. She didn\"t know why exactly, but she knew she could trust Sydney, that Syd wouldn\"t hurt her. It was the first time in a long time she had felt this way. But she also knew she had to tell Sydney what had happened to her. She would tell Alex as well, because she had come to like the blonde attorney almost as much as Sydney. And she knew both Sydney and Alex really wanted to know who she was. Not just to KNOW who she was but also in the hopes of being able to get the men and women who had hurt her. Sydney and Alex were in Syd\"s apartment talking after a day of shopping with Catriona. It was a girls day out and now they were talking (or at least Syd and Alex were talking ) about the men in their lives. Catriona was in her room, thinking about how to tell them. Out in the living room Sydney and Alex were talking about some of the \"adventures\" their men had been in but mostly they were laughing at the mishaps they had gotten into. Alex had finally gotten Sydney to admit she loved Gage and was now trying to convince her to tell Gage because he felt the same way about her. Sydney on the other hand was trying to explain to Alex that she didn\"t want to screw up the friendship and partnership they had, when Catriona walked into the room. She sat next to Sydney on the couch and waited for a lull in the conversation. Well it didn\"t take long for both women to notice the serious expression on Catriona\"s face. When only silence spoke in the room, Catriona leaned over and, surprising Syd, gave her a hug. This wass one of the few times she had willingly touched anyone. \"I\"ve got something to say. Please don\"t interrupt because this is very difficult. I will tell you what happened to me but only once so take notes or record it, I don\"t care.\" At this point Alex grapped her bag and remove the tape recorder she always had with her. When Catriona saw Alex was ready, she reached out, took a strong hold of Syd\"s hand and began the horror story, in a detached voice. \"My name is Catriona Anne Maeverly. My parents were Ronan and Elizabeth Maeverly. My Father was Irish, Mother was Canadian. I was born July 2, 1985 in Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada. I was an only child but it was no big deal, my parents always made sure I had lots of animals to play with.\" At this point Catriona stopped and allowed a small smile to show through, perhaps remembering all the fun she had when she was young. But just as quickly it was gone and the grim tale continued. \"I was orphaned when I was 9. My parents dead, the result of a drunk driver. And since both my Father\"s parents were dead, Mother\"s father was dead and Grandma was in a nursing home, dying and I had no other relatives, I was packed off to an orphanage. I lived there for a couple of years when I was kidnapped on February 7, 1996. It was a couple of years later when I figured out why it was me they had taken. Apparantly these men and women would go to an orphanage and pretend to be looking for a"]}

Still guzzling she raised an eyebrow as a sign for him to continue. \"Stop drinking.\" There was a small \"pop\" as her lips detached from the bottle. \"The beer?\" \"The coffee.\" There was silence for a moment as she sheepishly smiled, bringing the bottle back to her mouth. \"I was talking too fast again wasn\"t I?\" she murmured into its lip, enjoying the faint whistling sound it made. \"Not really. The dogs outside heard you pretty well at some points. Hey ow! No need for the hitting.\" \"Shut up.\" \"Take your own advice.\" They drank in silence for a while, listening to the bar chatter around them, lost in their own thoughts before he sighed and turned to face her properly. \"But seriously Als, lay off the coffee for a while. Every time I see you, you seem more wound up than a cat during a thunderstorm.\" He stated, ignoring the way she grinned at his comparison. It was quickly replaced with a stressful frown as she set her drink back on the bar, parting her lips as if she wanted to say something, but wasn\"t sure how. He crunched on the ice from his own drink as he waited patiently, knowing she\"d get there in the end. She hadn\"t had too much alcohol to really affect her just yet. \"Do I really seem that caffeinated?\" she whispered at long last, making him snort thoughtfully. \"You\"ve always been rather been a tad hyper, but with the way things have been going, you\"re starting to reach my standards.\" He smiled as she cringed. \"I knew I shouldn\"t have ordered that black coffee. But it was so damn good...\" she muttered exasperatedly, picking at the label on her nearly empty bottle in front of her. Trying not to eye her actions, he chose to take another sip of his drink before realising it was empty. Signalling for another, he turned to see the growing pile of shredded paper in front of her and tried to keep his cool. \"H-hey Ally...I know I asked you this last week, but...are you sure you aren\"t stressed?\" he suggested weakly, knowing he was treading dangerous territory. He accepted his new girly, but delicious tasting cocktail from the bartender as he waited for her response, only to be pleasantly surprised when she shrugged tiredly. \"It\"s ok Austin, I\"m not going to hit you.\" She muttered, still picking, \"It\"s just...with all this work, and the conventions, I\"m facing a lot of overtime at the moment, that I\"m glad that it\"s only coffee I\"ve turned to, to get me through this. Ya know?\" He hummed in response, trying to fight down the weird feeling in his stomach. Tipping her head back to look at the ceiling, she stared at something he couldn\"t see (maybe it was the vomit shaped stain above them...) as she continued to unload her feelings on him. \"Everyone expects too much from me. I know I\"ve been at the company for a while now, but honestly, can\"t they get off their own fat butts and do something for themselves for a change? \"Ally, can you get me those files from the Roberstons?' \"Ally, be a dear and handle this case for me?' \"Ally, baby, you know I love you, but you also know that I can\"t remain cooped up here in Miami with you all my life.' Stupid asses.\" She growled bitterly, sculling down the rest of her drink. He could only sit there and stare at her in shock as the bar tender placed another one on the bar. \"He left you?\" he said in disbelief. She nodded. \"When?\" \"Saturday. Good riddance.\" No wonder she was peeling that bottle label like crazy. \"Why didn\"t you tell me Als?\" \"Thought we had already established that Austin, I was busy. But enough about me. How\"s your week been? Surely you\"ve got a story to tell me since last week.\" She huffed, closing off the topic. He mimicked her careless shrug as nothing really came to mind. \"Not really. Sold a few more albums, tried to write a few more songs, the usual. Honestly, I feel like I need an addiction to bring some excitement back into my life.\" \"Don\"t,\" she gasped, eyes widening slightly in fear, which he quickly eased with a small smile. \"Joking Als, joking. I\"m not going down that path. Not after...\" he trailed off, both of them remembering their fallen friend. Out of habit, they both raised their drinks to the ceiling before bringing them down to clink together, murmurs of \"Dez\" on their lips. As they swallowed their liquor an old tune floated from the bar speakers, a favourite of Team Austin\"s from way back in the day. Taking it as a sign, Austin set down his drink before turning to extend an inviting hand to his companion. She wordlessly accepted it, allowing him to lead her to the dance floor. Tangling his fingers with hers, he rested his spare hand on her waist as her\"s travelled to his bicep. They started to sway, ignoring the other patrons of the small establishment, lost in their stressful bliss. \"I hate how we only meet up once a week.\" She murmured suddenly, voicing what he had been feeling for months. \"Me too.\" \"But with work, and separate lives and...everything, there just didn\"t seem time for Austin and Ally time anymore.\" She continued, shuffling closer so she could rest her head against his chest. He hummed lightly along with the tune and in agreement, bring their extend arms in to tuck against their sides. \"And after Chris dumped my ass, I desperately wanted to call you, but I had no idea where you were. And with Trish still AWOL after...well, I just settled for letting it brew up I guess.\" \"You should have called Ally. I would have hurried right over.\" \"I know, I just...I guess a part of me wanted to keep to traditions and unload everything in another drunken rant. Plus, I wasn\"t a pleasant sight to behold that night.\" He chuckled at her unintentional rhyme and kissed the top of her head affectionately. \"You\"re always a sight Ally.\" \"I don\"t know whether to be happy or offended by that. So I\"m going to go with both.\" He debated over something for a while as they continued to dance, not noticing when the song changed. She must have sensed it cause she pulled back slightly to look up at him questioningly. \"You\"re very quiet tonight. What\"s up?\" \"My label wants me to transfer-\" \"Again?\" \"-And I\"m actually considering it.\" She stopped abruptly, staring at him in shock. \"I feel like Miami is...what\"s that smart word?\" \"Lacklustre?\" \"Lacklustre after all these years, and I need a change of pace. Moving to LA or New York even could be what I need.\" She was silent for a moment, taking it all in with consideration, which he appreciated. Her response though was definitely not what he expected. \"Let\"s go on a road trip.\" It was his turn to look shocked. \"What?\" \"Let\"s go travelling!\" She whispered, her eyes gleaming excitedly, \"Get away from work, breakups, and all this...stress, and just relax. You. Me. The open road. Seeing America. Regaining all that Austin and Ally time we\"ve missed out on since high school. What do you think?\" \"I think you\"ve had more to drink that I realised.\" \"No. I\"m still sober...ish. But think about it Austin! I\"ve always wanted to travel Route 66, and why not now? I think we\"re both deserving of a vacation. Especially before everything hits the fan.\" \"Hasn\"t it already?\" \"Nah, I think a shit storm is making its way up the East coast. So, what do you think?\" He stood there, taking it all in. Here was his boringly sensible best friend, still dressed in her coffee stained black work dress, cheeks rosy from excitement and alcohol as she grinned at him, having spurted out the craziest idea he had ever heard. And he was seriously considering it. Eyeing her critically, he tried to think around the vodka in his system before replying. \"I\"d have to check with work-\" \"Yes!\" she shrieked happily, launching herself against him. \"Yes, yes, yes! Thankyou! You won\"t regret this, I promise! Oh my gosh, we\"re going to have so much fun! Gaaah, this is so exciting!\" Humming in delight she stepped back from their one-sided hug to clutch at his hands, swaying them side to side with her as she danced. Sighing, he couldn\"t help but grin weakly, allowing her to lead. Yup. To say that Ally was boring now was a far cry from the truth. A&A \"Hey Austin, have you seen my black flats?\" Looking up from his phone, he glanced around him quickly before picking up the pair of said shoes from behind his chair. Turning to see his friend\"s butt perked in the air as she checked under her bed he lobbed them at her, the direct hit causing her to squeal. \"Not called for! You could have just said.\" She scolded, rubbing at the spot where she had hit her head on the frame work. He just shrugged and grinned, trying to ignore how attractive she looked when she pouted. They were only half way through their journey, having started in Chicago two weeks ago. They hadn\"t wasted time in planning after their slightly intoxicated decision, and the following Friday their usually occupied seats at Rosie\"s Bar were empty as they flew up North. Now, in the heart of Oklahoma, he was tired, but happy with everything they had seen or done so far. They took turns in driving, with the idea that they\"d get there, when they\"d get there. Their respective works hadn\"t been too pleased with their sudden departures, but were understanding on the subject, putting it down to long subdued grief and stress, which they didn\"t bother to argue. Watching as Ally wriggled into a pair of short shorts, he thought over their friendship and how comfortable they were with each other. She was still insecure and a tad shy as an adult, but around him she didn\"t mind sharing a bed or walking around in only her underwear. In turn, she didn\"t voice any resistance to him doing the same, or if he drank from the milk carton. Possibly cause she shared that bad habit too. But it made him wonder, was he really that deep in the friend zone? From his retrospect, it was quite possible. And he didn\"t exactly have anyone to bounce his wonderments off anymore either. \"Austin? Heeeelllo? Earth to Austin? Sssccch. Huston, we have a problem.\" Ally\"s lame and overly tired joke brought him back, to see her face right up in his, brown doe eyes unblinking as she traced for any sign of life. \"How many times have I told you not to say that?\" \"How many times do you plan to zone out on me?\" \"...Touché.\" Grinning she grabbed his hands, hauling him from his seat eagerly, car keys jingling from around her fingers. \"Come on, we have to get going. There\"s this place I want to see just outside of town, and we\"re losing daylight.\" \"Ally, its only 8am. We\"ve got all day.\" He whined, but allowed her to lead him out of the motel room. \"And why not make the most of it. Besides, didn\"t you want to go somewhere tonight?\" she reminded him, locking the door behind them. He nodded as she absently linked her arm through his, another action that brought back the thoughts from earlier. She had been doing this a lot lately. Whenever they were walking, or sitting down side by side, he would usually feel her small arm wriggle its way around his elbow and rest there for as long as it wanted. She never said anything, so he didn\"t, but he dearly wished she wasn\"t leading him on. Friday nights had been bad enough with trying to keep his control, but being in close proximity 24/7, well, feelings might be unleashed by the end of this trip. \"So, where we going today?\" he asked, trying to shake away his lingering thoughts. She just grinned and tapped the side of her nose, causing him to groan good humouredly. \"Don\"t worry, you\"ll get to sleep in the car.\" She chuckled, clicking the beeper for the car alarm. Two hours later, she woke him up as they crossed the state boarder into Fort Smith. Seeing the city ahead of them, Austin groaned once again, thinking it was going to be another \"Ally Day\", filled with \"fun facts\" and \"amazing sites.' \"Oh shush. It\"s not going to be that bad.\" She giggled, a mischievous look in her eyes. It was for a while. She dragged him from historic site to historic site, gushing madly over each one, as she had done with most of their stops on the road trip so far. But come late afternoon, she surprised him by linking their hands together, and pulling him gently towards a café beside the river. Once seated, she just as gently pried the menu from his hands before pointing her head at a lone man standing behind an open case, a saxophone cradled in his hands. Intrigued, Austin twisted in his seat some more, waiting for him to start playing. He was rewarded for his patience as the most soulful sound rang in his ears, the sax belting out across the river. It wasn\"t long before another man appeared from nearby, crooning to the gathering crowd. \"This is a common occurrence.\" Turning to look back at his best friend, he saw a small glimmer of sadness in her eyes as she watched the duo. \"When Dad took me on one of his many road trip conventions, we ended up here, listening to the locals perform for hours. All the way home, all he could talk about was the Jazz. Days afterwards, I would hear him tinkering about with the brass instruments or the cello as he tried to recreate everything we had heard. It\"s those times that I remember just how passionate he is about music. He doesn\"t show it often, but it\"s the happiest I\"ve ever seen him.\" He was stunned for a moment, before pushing his chair out abruptly, moving it so he could sit side by side with her, linking their arms together. She just smiled and leaned her head against his shoulder. They never did order anything. Just sat there for hours, listening to the talent. A&A Reaching Los Angles wasn\"t as pleasing as they had thought. After all the excitement the last month had given them, the bright lights of the city made him want to turn the car around and head back out to the countryside. Ally seemed to have the same feeling as she rested her hand atop of his on the gearstick, murmuring, \"Do you wish we could just be nomads sometimes?\" To travel and just play music with his best friend at his side had always been his dream. But without the connections of record labels and paparazzi breathing down his neck? Hell, he\"d thought he\"d died and gone to heaven. \"I\"m not looking forward to going home in two days.\" He replied just as quietly, indicating off the interstate and onto a less crowded highway. \"Me neither.\" \"...have you heard anything?\" \"From work? I\"ve got a million messages I don\"t want to touch. From my Dad? Just a couple of \"can\"t wait to see you, hope you had a good trip\"s...\" She paused before inhaling a shaky breath, \"And there was one from Trish.\" He nearly rear ended the car in front of him. \"Seriously!\" \"Yeah. She, just txt me saying that she was safe, and that she had seen the pics of our trip. I dunno if she was talking about on Facebook, or in the magazines, but either way, she contacted me.\" \"It\"s a start.\" Austin mused, not really sure how to state how he was feeling. Ally\"s small hand squeezed his gently in response as she turned back to look out her window. Seeing this, he debated internally for a moment before hurriedly pulling into a side exit, looking out for a way to loop back around. Surprised, Ally glanced at him questioningly, but he just shook his head. \"I can\"t count how many times you\"ve made the executive decision to go on tangent this month, so now it\"s my turn. Just go with it.\" He instructed, signalling back into the traffic going the way they had just come. She frowned but settled back in her seat, letting him drive in peace. A few hours later, around midnight, he pulled up the limestone driveway, pleased to see their destination was as he had remembered. Ally didn\"t need to be awakened as her eyes fluttered open when he shut off the car. Before her was a large farm house, glowing in the moonlight and solar lanterns littering the wide front porch. \"Where...?\" \"My grandma\"s. She\"s out of town at the moment, but when she heard we were heading this way, she said we were welcome to crash here if we wanted.\" He explained with a self-pleased smile. She returned the gesture fondly before looking back out at the house. \"It\"s gorgeous Austin.\" \"Well, come on. Let\"s go inside.\" He said cheerfully, popping open his door. A few minutes later, after hunting for the key in the pot plant soil, and dragging their gear inside, the duo wordlessly succumbed to their weariness and trooped upstairs to the guest bedroom. It wasn\"t long before they were asleep in each other\"s arms. Austin awoke the next morning to see Ally\"s face directly in his once again, watching as he slept. \"A tad creepy, but hello.\" He muttered hoarsely, hoping she couldn\"t feel his morning woody. She hummed before crossing her arms across his chest and propping her head against them, lying half across him, completely unaware of her effect on him as she continued to stare. \"W-what?\" he stuttered, trying to ignore the way her tank top strap was slipping. \"I just realised how in a couple of days I wouldn\"t be able to do this anymore.\" She replied, frowning thoughtfully. \"It made me sad. You\"re fun to watch when sleeping.\" \"I don\"t know whether to be happy or offended by that. So I\"m going to go with both.\" He chuckled, making her grin when she caught the reference. Swatting at his chest lightly, she wriggled onto him further, enjoying his warmth. \"I mean, in a couple of days we\"ll be going back to our boring 9-5 lives. And then...well, you could be moving here. And I\"ll be stuck there.\" She explained, the sadness creeping back into her voice. Lifting his arms to wrap around her waist he propped his head up a bit so he could look at her properly. \"I still haven\"t decided if I\"m going to take them up on their offer just yet Ally.\" \"But you will.\" \"How do-\" \"I know you Austin. I\"ve know you for a good ten years. We aren\"t best friends for nothing.\" She smiled. \"We are aren\"t we?\" he mused, knowing that this topic was broaching a sensitive area. \"Are what?\" \"Best friends.\" His simple response made her stiffen slightly before her shoulders slumped. \"Y-yeah.\" They were silent, both considering whether or not to push the topic further, before Ally sighed and rolled off him and out of bed, hunting for a clean set of clothes. After confirming that it was okay to the use the shower, he watched her leave before slumping back against the mattress, cursing under his breath to himself. He had to settle this. He had to settle it today, before life tore them apart again. A few hours later, after walking around the estate, they were sitting on the front porch, talking mildly and enjoying the day when Austin stopped suddenly and kicked off his shoes. \"Take your shoes off.\" \"Whhh...why?\" \"Just, kick your shoes off.\" He instructed, jumping to his feet. She followed slowly, but not reluctantly, wriggling her toes against the sun worn wood. Taking her into his arms, he began to sway, humming an unfamiliar tune. She was pleasantly surprised and soon relaxed into the notion, resting her head against his broad chest, listening to the vibrations as he sang. \"Singing, hold my loving arms, my loving arms are for you. Hold my loving arms, my loving arms are for you.\" He didn\"t need to say anything else. She simply lifted her head and let him kiss her as they continued to sway, the tune now forgotten. A&A \"So how was work today?\" \"Uggggh. See this stain?\" \"Is that the coffee stain from...?\" \"No. I just got that one out. This, is from the soda he managed to spill today. By \"pure accident\" might I add.\" Chuckling Austin, patted her hand comfortingly before taking a sip of his lime flavoured cocktail. She watched him over the edge of her drink thoughtfully, her question evident on her face. \"Go on, just a-\" \"Why do you drink those?\" \"They taste good.\" \"And beer doesn\"t?\" \"I don\"t want a beer-belly.\" Snorting, she sipped at her favoured drink before swivelling in her stool to look out over their favourite bar. They were silent for a while before she finally broached the elephant in the room. \"I can\"t believe you leave soon.\" \"I\"m only going to be gone for a month.\" \"But that\"s too long.\" She scowled, still not looking at him. \"Am I selfish to say I want you here? Suffering with me?\" He thought about it for a moment before turning in his seat as well, leaning up against the bar. \"...no. No, I think that\"s completely reasonable.\" \"What if you decide to stay there permanently?\" \"Then I\"ll arrange a transfer for you to be at my side...that\"s, only if you want to be.\" He suggested, suddenly unsure. One corner of her mouth slopped upwards slightly as she began to pick at the beer label again. \"Ok.\" A million things in that question was suddenly answered, nearly a month after their holiday. Picking up her hand to kiss her knuckles, he jumped down from his seat before tugging her lightly towards the dance floor. She smiled shyly in return, answering his unspoken question, her old black work dress fluttering around her knees. Pulling her towards him he rested his chin against her head as she tucked herself in against his chest, tangling their hands together. Squirreled away from the madness of their day to day lives and the city, they swayed in their favourite haunt, humming the same tune under their breaths. \"Singing, hold my loving arms, my loving arms are for you. Hold my loving arms, my loving arms are for you.\"", "\"Keiko. Just, shh, for a moment.\" Kimiko interrupted in amusement, smiling at the twinkle apparent in her friend\"s eye. \"Since when have you and Clay been talking?\" \"Since you meet him?\" Keiko stated, looking a tad confused. \"You\"re still talking to him? I thought that died out after a while.\" Kimiko muttered in bewilderment, before giving an approving look. \"I\"m glad.\" \"No, we still talk. Maybe not as often as we all use to, but enough. Anyway, you should ask your father once your trip is confirmed if you can get some leave.\" \"As tempting as it sounds, I don\"t know if he\"d allow it...\" \"Just spin him a little tale about how you can\"t focus properly on all this new information you\"re being overloaded with, and need some R&R time so you can sort through it. And what better place to do than America, on Clay\"s ranch, away from the business world?\" Keiko encouraged. Kimiko mulled over it for a moment or two more before nodding slightly in agreement. Punching the air silently, Keiko danced happily in her seat as Kimiko watched her, thoroughly amused. Getting an idea she smiled brightly, regaining her friend\"s attention. \"You should come with me. I\"m sure that Clay would love to meet you at long last. That is, if you two haven\"t already met behind my back.\" She teased, watching as Keiko flushed good naturedly. \"Damn, you caught me there.\" She chuckled before deflating noticeably, \"I would love to, but the lawyers have just announced a big case is heading towards the firm, and everyone is needed on board to get through it.\" \"Even the clerks?\" \"Even us lil old clerks. Dunno what the case is about, but it must be important. My department manager was muttering about taxes, air control and important business men.\" Keiko confirmed, moodily stirring at the remains of her soup. Lifting her gaze for a moment, she frowned slightly, feeling as if something was off. \"Hey, is something up? Aside from you being tired?\" Startled, Kimiko looked at her wide eyed. \"No. What makes you ask that?\" Shrugging Keiko sat back up, puffing air through her nose thoughtfully. \"No reason. Just felt like something was wrong. So tell me, did that mystery txter reply?\" Trying not to fidget, Kimiko shook her head ruefully. \"No, which I suppose was for the better. I mean, what I sent back was kinda weird.\" She added guiltily. Keiko nodded in agreement before moving on to talk about other mundane things. As she listened, Kimiko silently apologised for lying to her friend, uncomfortably aware of her phone in her skirt pocket. She had a bad feeling that if she had be truthful, Keiko would demand her to stop txting Raimundo, before launching into a lecture about her health and well-being, which was not really need right now. Besides, she hadn\"t made a new friend in years. She had acquaintances, sure, but aside from Keiko and Clay, no one else she considered true friends. If she keyed her in on this blossoming friendship it\"d be over before it even started. Besides, she wanted to get to know the Brazilian a little more before telling her about him. Resolving to get to know him a little bit better next time, she joined in on the currently one-sided conversation. Waving the attendant over again, she ordered another pot of tea for them to share, before enquiring about Tokyo\"s social life, watching as her friend\"s eyes sparkled. Still tired, but decidedly happier, Kimiko smiled, relaxing as she enjoyed the atmosphere and music, as well as Keiko\"s animated explanations. Business trips, paper work and friendships could wait. Right now, what was important was the interoffice relationship brewing on the horizon between Okichi and Akahito. \"Hey, Raimundo, have you seen my phone?\" Looking up from said phone at Clarice\"s shout, the young man yelled back a negative, before listening as she huffed in annoyance, resuming her search elsewhere in the house. Chuckling, he turned back to his txt, thumb flying over the keys. He was in good spirits. Only three more days until the end of work and he could already picture those sweet, sweet waves. And the sun warmed sand. Ohhh, and the beach, free of the summer tourism. Sighing wistfully Raimundo looked at the phone vacantly, already transported to his favourite surfing spot. \"Raimundo! I know you have my phone!\" Aaaand, he was back. Grumbling he finished his txt to Kimiko, warning her not to txt back for a bit before shoving the phone in his work shoes, knowing Clarice would never search there. \"I told ya, I don\"t have it!\" he yelled back, only to hear her storming up the hallway towards him. \"Then where the hell is it? I haven\"t seen it for days now, and I just know you have it. It\"s like an itch I just can\"t scratch.\" She growled, stretching out the end of her sentence threateningly. Keeping his expression blank, Raimundo stepped aside and invited her into his room with a flourish of his hand. \"Feel free to look around. But I\"m warning you, I don\"t have your stupid phone.\" She looked at him carefully before haughtily stepping through the doorway, her eagle eyes looking for a place to start. He settled for leaning in the doorjamb, amused when she started with his work gear first. Like he suspected, she took one sniff of his shoes before withdrawing quickly, readily turning to another hiding spot. As he continued to watch her hunt, his thoughts drifted back to Rio. He needed to resume looking for a proper job while he was there, one that was close to the sea but preferably didn\"t require him to be gutting fish all day, every day. Maybe there was an equipment hire store that was looking for employees. He could always extend his mentoring business, but that required a lot of effort and starting costs for advertisements, starter surfboards, wax, repair kits; it was a lot to consider in the long run. And then, if he did find a job, there was all the loose ends to tie up here. Quitting his job at the factory wouldn\"t be hard and he was easily replaceable. Packing shouldn\"t be too difficult, though it might require some time to move everything. And he could also hire another car or a truck. No, in fact, the move would be easy. The only thing that was really holding him back was- \"Gah, I can\"t find it. You sold it didn\"t you, you little brat.\" -His family. Narrowing his eyes at his older sister he snorted in disbelief. \"And just why would I do that?\" \"I don\"t know. Because you\"re greedy and wanted more money? You tell me.\" She huffed. A little peeved at the old excuse, Raimundo straightened up and gestured for her to get out. \"Piss off.\" \"Why don\"t you?\" \"You know perfectly why I can\"t. Now get out of my room.\" He snarled, moving towards his bed. \"My house, my room. Now, where the hell is my phone?\" \"I don\"t know okay?!\" he shouted before flopping back on his bed, \"Jeez.\" \"Someone obviously isn\"t getting any.\" Clarice sneered causing him to freeze. That was a low blow, even for her. And she was supposed to be the one sibling he got along with the best. Turning to face her slowly, his glare didn\"t really match his tone. \"And why do you think that is hmm? Maybe because I work 24/7? Do you even know what it\"s like to work? Do you even know what a job is?\" he hissed, noting with some satisfaction at the wince that flashed across her face. \"Don\"t you lecture me about a job little boy. You rode on the coattails of life for long enough and now this is you paying it back.\" \"How? By paying for both our living expenses and sending money across the country to everyone else? They can all go out there get jobs as well. I don\"t see how it\"s my responsibility to be their caretaker.\" He snapped, sitting up again as Clarice smirked slightly. \"You ran away. So, you get to pay.\" \"I didn\"t want to continue living in that...circus.\" \"So you ran to Laguna? What a rebel Rai, what. A. Rebel.\" There was a moment of tense silence between the two siblings before Raimundo sighed tiredly, leaning back on his hands as he stared at the ceiling. \"You know why I ran away Clare. I mean, you followed me.\" He murmured sadly. Clarice\"s stance softened, a look of guilt washing over her. \"Yeah, but that doesn\"t change anything Rai. I mean, I already had a job and a home to call my own before I left. You just, vanished.\" \"And I\"d do it again.\" He said, fixing her with a levelled look. Seeing her arch an eyebrow in disbelief he felt urge to strengthen his resolve to find a new job and leave. \"I will! I was sick of everything then, and I\"m still sick of it. I just needed my space.\" \"Why? Ma and Pa always dotted on you. You were the youngest. You got everything you wanted while the rest of us had to work for it.\" She muttered before looking away sulkily. \"I had that once. Then you brats came along and snatched it from me.\" \"Clare, I-\" \"No pity.\" She snapped before pinching the space between her eyes, \"No pity. I didn\"t mean it that way Rai, it\"s just, sometimes, I mean, our family...\" He watched her struggle to express how she felt, smiling softly in understanding. \"It\"s too complicated for words.\" \"Aye,\" she grinned sadly, \"Too complicated.\" Before he could say anything she reverted back to her original anger and stormed towards the door, warning him over her shoulder that she\"d kill him if she found him with her phone. Watching as his door slammed close, Raimundo couldn\"t help by to grin as well before waiting for her foot steps to fade away. Jumping off his bed, he dived for the hidden phone, pleased to see Kimiko hadn\"t txt him during the argument. After alerting her that he was back, he got to his feet and headed over to the tiny window, overlooking the street. Watching a group of sour looking teenagers were milling around an over flowing garbage can, which was suspiciously smoking, he pondered over everything that had just happened. It was about time he got serious about leaving. Tubarão may have held a good life for him once upon a time, but now, he felt like he was being called elsewhere. Somewhere with good surf, beaches and warmer weather- The phone in his hand bleeped pleasantly and he grinned at the welcome back message Kimiko had sent him. -And, maybe a place with new friends. Heels clicking as she walked down the hallway, she jangled through the dozens of keys absently, listening with a smile to her companion. \"They really said that? Ha, and you...you didn\"t! Oh wow, did they run for the hills?\" She paused for a moment, holding up a particular key for closer inspection, phone cradled between her ear and shoulder, before dropping it back onto the ring with a laugh. \"Oh how I hope you got pictures! To see those bloody tycoons running with their tails between their legs, it\"s just perfect.\" Glancing at her surroundings, she did a quick count of the apartment numbers before swivelling on her heel, back tracking a few doors. Searching through the keys again, she located the right one, humming in response to whatever was being whispered in her ear as she unlocked the door. Shushing them for a moment, she stuck her head in, checking the neatly lined shoes and slippers before slipping inside. Closing the door with a soft snap she locked it again, resting on the frame as she tried to hear if anyone was in the house. A quiet murmur by her left ear made her jump guilty, before she realised it was her phone. \"Shhhh Clay! I\"m trying to figure out if Kimi\"s home or not.\" She hissed, kicking off her shoes, courteously lining them up next to the wall. Clay mumbled something to her as she located a pair of slippers in her size, making her scowl. \"Oh hush. I\"m not breaking any rules or nothing. I\"m just...surveying.\" She explained as she trudged through the pin clean living room towards her friend\"s bedroom, checking the couch and armchair along the way. \"She\"s been out of sorts lately, and I want to know why. And before you ask in that Texan drawl of yours, \"why don\"t ya just ask her yerself\"- hey, I thought that was a pretty good impression thankyou- I have tried asking her. But she just gets this distant look in her eyes and- hold up.\" Peering into the dark room, she took note of the unslept in bed, frowning. The room itself looked like no one had been there in days. \"Weird. Hey, I\"m going to put you on speaker. Wait a moment.\" Removing the small device from where it had imprinted itself against her neck, Keiko tapped a couple of functions as she stepped back into the living room. Settling the phone beside her on the desk, she began opening draws, hunting for anything that might hint towards Kimiko\"s strange behaviour, still yakking away to Clay as she did. \"Ok, so lately when you ask her about what\"s been going on in her life, she gets this weird look in her eye and then goes back to clicking away at her phone. It\"s like it\"s glued to her hand or something. This past week, I haven\"t seen her without it nearby.\" \"But she\"s always got her phone Kei. Especially with this whole trip you said they\"re planning, she\"d need to have it nearby.\" Clay\"s static response rang through the silent apartment as she slumped into a chair, pulling a draw out to rest on her lap. \"Yeah, usually. But I\"m telling you honey, this is different. She smiles and it\"s a happy smile, not her medication influenced one or her strained \"I\"m worked to the bone\" one either. It\"s truly...happy.\" \"And she can\"t be happy?\" He pointed out as she thumbed through a stack of papers. \"No. I mean, yes. I mean...\" she trailed off, blushing guilty as he chuckled lightly. Giving the phone a dirty look she resumed her searching muttering, \"She\"s allowed to be happy, but lately it\"s like she hasn\"t had anything to be happy about. She\"s been so busy with work and the last time I saw that smile was when I suggested she take some leave and go see you. Wait, you haven\"t been talking to her have you?\" \"Now, now Keiko, you know that you monopolise all my time-\" \"Oh shut up.\" \"-But no, I haven\"t heard from her.\" There was a thoughtful pause which had her turning fully to her phone, attention captured. \"You thought of something.\" \"How could you tell?\" \"Please honey, I know you. Now, what\"s on your mind?\" He sighed deeply and she could just picture him rubbing small circles against his brow as he settled back in his old chair. \"Has she...met anyone lately?\" Frowning Keiko drew another stack of papers towards her. \"You mean, as in a guy?\" \"Yeah. A boy.\" \"A boy?\" \"A boy. Or maybe a girl. Dunno which way she swings.\" He chuckled, earning a grin from Keiko. \"But, it could explain why she\"s so happy.\" \"My little Kimiko has a \"friend\"!\" She squealed, before dropping the file she was holding. \"Oh shit! Kimiko has a \"friend\". Clay, she hasn\"t made a new friend since you! Oh gods, we could be on the edge of potential disaster. What if they find out about her mental state and dump her ass! Or, or what if they\"re just using her? What if, they force her to do something that could harm her?\" \"Woah, woah, slow down sugar! Keep that up and I\"m going to have to get Kimiko to share her meds with you.\" \"Not funny.\" \"Take a deep breath and relax and it won\"t be. Now, calm down. We don\"t know anything at this point in time. And you\"re going to have to be subtle when asking her. Can you do that? Cause, I know you\"re not the best at being tactical.\" \"One time! It was one time and I thought you\"d let that go by now!\" \"I\"m never going to. But focus sugar! This could be a good thing. Like you said, the last person she made friends with was me. She may try to deny it, but we really are her only true friends. We need to go about this carefully. Don\"t scare her off them. Let her tell you when she\"s comfortable about talking about it.\" \"But Clay,\" she whined. \"No buts. Now-\" he stopped suddenly, and she heard a chair scrap across the ground roughly before a string of accented swears. \"Clay honey? What\"s wrong?\" \"They\"re back.\" She paled, fumbling to pick up her phone. Turning it off speaker, she held it close to her, feeling like she was closer to him as she did. \"Clay, settle down. Don\"t let them see you angry. We\"ve talked about this remember?\" \"I\"m gonna find my Daddy\"s gun, and shot those buzzard bastards right off my front stoop.\" He growled in response, and she could hear him hunting through the cupboard. \"Clay, stop! You do that and you\"ll attract more remember? Buzzards are attracted to dead meat.\" He cursed but stopped riffling around. \"Good. Now, do you breathing exercises....good. Now, when they knock on the door, tell them civilly that you\"re still not accepting their offer.\" \"What if they produce legal documents?\" \"Then scan them and send them to me. I\"ll get someone over here to help go over them.\" \"Thanks sweetheart, but I don\"t think Japanese laws apply over here.\" She smiled at his light chuckle. \"True, but surely it\"s the same language. We can help.\" \"You\"re the best, you know that?\" \"I know.\" She heard a knock from his end, and he cursed again before taking a deep breath in. \"Listen, I gotta go. Say hi to Kimiko for me will ya? And tell me what happens.\" \"And the same to you. Love you. Good luck.\" She murmured. \"Love you too sugar. And thanks.\" With that he hung up, leaving her to sit in a silent apartment. Sighing raggedly, she pocketed her phone before returning the files and draw to their rightful spot. Checking the time, she headed towards the kitchen, flicking on the kettle, before hunting through the cupboards. A few minutes later, just as it shrilled loudly, the front door clicked open, revealing a dishevelled looking Kimiko. \"Hey.\" \"I should have known you\"d be here.\" She sighed, unlacing her shoes. \"Don\"t act like you don\"t appreciate it. Here, I made you some tea.\" Keiko offered her a steaming mug which she accepted with a quiet thanks before trooping over to her couch. Plopping down with an exhausted \"oomph\" she closed her eyes as Keiko finished bustling around her tiny kitchen, eventually making her way over. Sitting down beside her, she trailed a critical eye over the younger girl. Her pony tail was limp and barely secure, tendrils of hair hanging around her ears. She cheeks were flushed while the rest of her was paler than usual. She could see the pronounced veins along and around her eyes. She was shaking slightly, her cup quivering in her grasp. Gently prising it from her hands, Keiko set it on the table before reaching behind her for the quilt she always kept nearby. Flicking it out, she draped it over the quiet girl, motherly tucking the stray strands of hair off her face. \"You\"re not going to work tomorrow.\" This made Kimiko\"s eyes snap open in protest, but Keiko held up a hand to stop whatever argument was brewing. \"You need some rest Kimiko. I saw your room. Have you even slept here for the last few nights? Have you slept at all? Cause frankly, you look like shit.\" Kimiko shuffled sheepishly in her seat, before murmuring a small, \"No.\" \"You\"ve been at work haven\"t you?\" \"Yeah. I got a couple hours of sleep in the breakroom this morning, and I cleaned myself up in the restroom. Used some wet wipes. But I had to get this new computer programme installed, and then there\"s that bloody paperwork.\" She trailed off, muttering under her breath about killing all photocopiers, printers and fax machines, unconsciously pulling her phone out of her pocket as she did. It was silent for a moment as she tapped away, a smile settling on her lips as Keiko watched her with narrowed eyes. \"You\"re not going to work.\" Faster than Kimiko could say \"What?' her friend had pounced, trapping her in the quilt as she snatched for her phone. Struggling against her, she held the cell as far away as she possibly could, but Keiko just crawled over her, nearly kneeing her in the face as she did. Clamping her hands around Kimiko\"s smaller one, she prised her fingers apart as if she were the Jaws of Life, catching the falling phone expertly. Pinning her still struggling friend, she swiped off the safe lock on screen before starting to hunt through her contacts for work. Well, she was going to when something else caught her attention. One new message from \"Raimundo\" \"Kimi...\" Just her tone told her what Keiko had read. Thrashing about she tried to reach around the quilt for her phone, but the older girl just held it further away. \"Who\"s...Ai-moon-doe?\" She asked, struggling with his name. \"None of your beeswax.\" \"Is this who you\"ve been txting non-stop this week?\" Keiko gasped, flicking through the read txts in bemusement. \"It\"s none of your beeswax.\" \"Oh my...for the love of high end jewellery! Kimiko! When did you meet this guy? When did you make a friend?\" she gushed excitedly, turning to the now pissed Japanese girl beneath her. \"Get off me, and I might tell you.\" Hurrying to obey, Keiko scrabbled to the far end of the couch, holding the phone tightly to her chest, waiting eagerly for the story. \"Give me my phone.\" \"Not a chance.\" \"Then it\"s none of your damn beeswax.\" Debating it carefully for a moment, Keiko sighed and relinquished the phone with a grumble. Kimiko pocketed it safely before sighing tiredly, wondering where to start. \"Remember how I got those strange txts and I freaked?\" at Keiko\"s cautious nod she mumbled, \"I lied when I told you they hadn\"t txted back.\""]}
{"id": "25a89a03-53dc-557c-a460-608c50c148cc", "fandoms": ["Boondock Saints", "Garfield"], "pair": ["\"I\"ve never been more serious,\" said Sean as he grabbed the back of Norman\"s head and forcefully kissed him. Norman, caught off guard, felt a shock of adrenaline shoot through him as his body was drained of all feeling everywhere except where Sean was touching him. He focused on the warm wetness of Sean\"s lips and thought he would burst when he felt Sean\"s tongue tease his lips. He reluctantly parted his mouth slightly to accept Sean\"s tongue. Sean inserted just the right amount of tongue into Norman\"s moist, hot mouth and pressed his body into Norman. He could feel the hardened bulge beneath Sean\"s jeans against his own growing erection and it turned him on so much it surprised even him. He reached behind him to set the beer he held in his left hand on the stove and brought his hands up to squeeze Sean\"s neck as they continued to passionately kiss. Sean broke away to pull his shirt off and toss it across his suite. Norman drank in the awesomeness of Sean\"s body: tight, toned, muscular, and enchanted by the sun. He couldn\"t believe that the oppressed fantasies he had harbored about this very situation were coming true. He felt Sean\"s hands creep up his shirt and caress his back, giving him chill bumps. He gently unbuttoned Norman\"s shirt up and slid it off his shoulders, dropping it onto the floor as he looked deep into Norman\"s sexy blue eyes with a pleading, questioning gaze. \"You sure you want this?\" he asked softly. Norman could do nothing but stare back into Sean\"s beautiful azure eyes and slowly nod yes. That was all the encouragement Sean needed as he dove back into Norman\"s exquisite and now shirtless body, kissing him deeply. He placed his hands, which were shaking from adrenaline and nervousness, on Norman\"s hipbones, just at the waistband of his worn blue jeans, and guided him gently over to the bed. He wasn\"t sure just how far Norman wanted him to go, or even how far he wanted to go for that matter. He didn\"t overthink it though. He figured he\"d let it unfold as it may. As they continued to kiss and rub their hands over one another\"s bodies, they seemed to automatically begin inching toward the bed without giving it any thought. When they arrived at the foot of the bed, with trembling hands, Sean began to undo Norman\"s belt and unbutton his pants. Norman took in a deep, baited breath as he waited for what was to come with anticipation. Sean slowly dragged the zipper of Norman\"s pants down, almost unsure if he really wanted this after all. But he didn\"t have to wonder long, because as soon as he felt Norman drag his bottom lip sensually along his, it renewed the fact that he did, and he opened the fly of Norman\"s pants like a child eagerly opening a Christmas present. Norman\"s dark blue boxer briefs peeked out of his fly, just waiting to be released from its duty to cover. Sean looked down to admire the sight of Norman with his shirt off and pants unzipped. He had seen him naked before when they were filming obviously, but not alone in a room and not erect. He couldn\"t wait to be pressed against Norman\"s soft, hot, naked body, and better yet, somewhere inside that body eventually. He just wondered if Norman would really let that happen. They resumed kissing and now that Norman was really starting to let go and enjoy it, the kissing became a power struggle, each man trying to dominate the other. Norman knew Sean would end up winning the battle for dominance because he always did. Sean demanded dominance, and he demanded supremacy. But this time, Norman didn\"t mind. He was happy to let Sean take him over. Turned on by how much Norman was now starting to show how much he was enjoying this, Sean confidently pulled Norman\"s pants and boxer briefs down just enough to reveal Norman\"s six-inch, circumcised excitement, just dampened with precum. Sean snuck a quick glance and feasted his eyes on the beautiful, smooth, hard, and hot dick that was now only inches away from his. He slowly wrapped his hand around it, taking delight in how good it felt even in his hand. He began to timidly and deliberately stroke it as Norman began to breathe heavier and shakier. Sean was numb with desire as he leaned in and kissed Norman again, this time a soft and passionate kiss. Norman felt ecstasy welling within him as he fought hard not to cum already. Sean\"s big, strong hand pulling at his erection was a new level of pleasure he had never experienced before. He felt like a virgin again having his first handjob by a girl. He suppressed his desire for a moment, long enough to reach over and undo Sean\"s belt and unbutton his pants. He pressed against Sean\"s stiff bulge with the palm of his hand for a few circles before gripping his fingers around it firmly. He squeezed tightly as Sean let out an enticed grunt of pleasure. They continued to kiss deeply while Sean let go of Norman\"s cock to help him pull down his own pants and boxers. Once they were down around his knees, he went back to stroking Norman\"s waiting dick. Norman apprehensively wrapped his beautiful fingers around Sean\"s seven-and-a-half inch, circumcised, thick cock. It felt strange and foreign to be touching a penis other than his own, but it was a good strange that he embraced, kind of like visiting a city in another country. Everything was familiar but so wonderfully new. He tugged at Sean\"s dick in rhythmic, even strokes while Sean reciprocated and they both let out soft, sporadic moans as they breathed heavily. Finally, when Sean felt like he was near the brink of orgasm he gently pulled Norman\"s hand away from his dick and stopped stroking Norman\"s as well. Never breaking the kiss, he put his hands on Norman\"s shoulders and softly pushed him down onto the bed into a sitting position, then gently coaxed him back further until he was lying down, and draped his hot body, just starting to glisten with the sweat of desire in the moonlight, on top of Norman\"s. They both kicked off their shoes and pants the rest of the way, which fell on Sean\"s floor with a soft thud. Their hard manhood was now pressed against one another\"s and Sean started to move his hips in a circular motion, grinding against Norman as they continued to kiss. Norman raised his hips slightly to meet Sean\"s, and as the pressure and movement continued and became more fervent, they both emitted intermittent, soft grunts of pleasure. \"Wow,\" Norman whispered in Sean\"s ear, \"you\"re so hard.\" \"It\"s all you, baby,\" he grinned at him as he grinded into him even harder, \"so what do you want to do? How far are we gonna take this thing?\" \"I don\"t know,\" blushed Norman shyly in staggered breaths, \"whatever you want to do is fine.\" \"Dammit Reedus, stand up for what you want!\" said Sean firmly as he stopped grinding, rose up with his arms straightened, and looked Norman square in the eye, \"put it out there. Tell me, Sean I want to - you fill in the blank...or we can just quit now.\" Awestruck, Norman thought for a moment as he looked up into Sean\"s blue eyes. \"I, uh...\" he stammered. \"Tell me, Norm. What do you want?\" \"Sean,\" he began, and then leaned in to sensually whisper in Sean\"s ear, \"I want you to fuck me.\" As equally turned on as he was impressed with Norman\"s candor and affirmation, and a little surprised that Norman skipped everything else and went directly to sex, Sean raised his eyebrows, nodded at him approvingly, and began kissing and grinding on Norman again. \"Ah yeah,\" Norman whispered as his eyes rolled back in his head, overcome with pleasure. Sean reluctantly stopped grinding again to reach into his night stand and pull out a condom and the medium-sized tube of warming lube he used for solo play or to entertain a lady friend. \"Warming,\" he smiled at Norman. Norman raised his eyebrows, smiled and said, \"I\"m sure that\"s not going to feel weird at all.\" \"Sorry man, it\"s all I\"ve got. Unless you want me to go in dry?\" joked Sean. \"Nooo thank you,\" grinned Norman. Sean sat up on his knees as he unwrapped the condom and slipped it over his throbbing cock. He applied a liberal amount of lube to his fingertips and rubbed it all over his latex-clad dick. He then handed the tube to Norman and said, \"Here, lube yourself up.\" \"I don\"t know how much to use, Sean. I\"ve never done this before,\" said Norman. \"I don\"t know how much to tell you to use! This is new territory for me too, Norm. I\"ve never been fucked in the ass either.\" Norman shrugged, opened the tube and squirted a generous amount onto his fingertips. He reached down around his leg and applied it to himself. It began to get warm, providing a strange and foreign sensation in a place he\"d never thought of having any new sensation. I don\"t know what the fuck I\"m thinking, he thought to himself, this is gonna hurt like hell. I must be crazy. \"You ready?\" Sean whispered as he lay back down on top of Norman, \"are we really gonna do this?\" \"As long as you still respect me in the morning,\" Norman grinned at him. Sean smiled back as he lifted Norman\"s legs up slightly, pushing them toward Norman\"s chest and gripping his thighs tightly. He looked down at Norman\"s ruggedly beautiful face, a look of anticipation painted on it with the innocence of a child. Sean smiled fondly down at him as he removed his right hand from Norman\"s thigh to grip his own rigid dick and guide it into Norman\"s waiting entrance. He lined himself up just right and began to slowly push himself into Norman\"s body. He had to fight the urge to plunge himself into him with one swift thrust, but he didn\"t want to hurt Norman. \"Oh fuck,\" exclaimed Norman as he accepted Sean into him, gripping the bottom sheet with both hands. Sean pushed forward inch by inch until he was safely all the way inside. Norman bit his lip as he suppressed the urge to cry out in a mixture of pain and pleasure. \"I think it\"ll hurt less if you relax,\" Sean whispered to him. \"I thought you said this new territory,\" said Norman quickly and through clenched teeth, his eyes shut tightly. \"Well I\"ve done it to girls,\" said Sean, \"haven\"t you?\" Norman shook his head no, with a look of embarrassment. Something else Sean had bested him at. \"Helena thinks that\"s gross too. I never had the guts to ask anyone else to do it,\" he said, still through clenched teeth, trying to become accustomed to the pain of having Sean inside his virginal area. \"Wow...\" remarked Sean as he buried himself deep inside Norman, \"that\"s kinda hot. Sort of makes me feel...creative or something.\" Norman took a deep breath to relax and let out a moan as Sean pushed as deeply into him as he possibly could and pulled up with his hips slightly. All of a sudden Norman jumped with a start. When Sean went deep and pulled up he hit something inside Norman that felt divine. \"What? Did I hurt you?\" Sean asked, concerned. \"No, do that again! Push in deep and pull up with your hips again! Please! Do it please!\" Norman begged. Sean did as he was asked and repeated the movement that had apparently given Norman immense pleasure. Norman arched his back, tilted his head back, grabbed the pillows behind his head and let out a primal, guttural scream. \"Oh God, Sean! Yes! Just like that! Yes! Do it! Harder! Faster! Oh my God, you\"re gonna make me cum! Yes!\" Sean gained more and more confidence with every thrust as Norman yelled louder and louder until finally Sean felt Norman\"s orifice tighten around his dick as streams of hot cum spurted onto Norman\"s stomach and he screamed, \"Oh fuck!\" Seeing that he was giving Norman such immense pleasure and feeling the spasms of Norman\"s body as he came proved to be the push he needed to send him into his own orgasmic spasm and he came harder than he had ever cum in his life, tucked safely inside his best friend. He filled the condom to capacity with thick, white semen. He collapsed down onto Norman, burying his face in Norman\"s neck, kissing it lightly. \"That. Was. Incredible,\" said Norman, gasping for breath, his dick still twitching from the mind blowing orgasm he had just experienced with absolutely no stimulation to his penis. He never dreamed that something there could feel so amazing. Sean withdrew himself, removed the condom, tied it off, and threw it in the trash can beside the bed. He handed Norman a tissue and Norman wiped off his stomach. Sean lay down on the pillow next to Norman, his back to him. \"So...,\" said Norman suggestively as he stroked Sean\"s upper arm with his index finger and pressed his chest against Sean\"s back, \"you said the fact that I\"ve never done that to anyone made you feel creative...what did you mean?\" His question was met with silence, then the deep breathing that told Norman Sean had fallen asleep. \"Sean?\" he whispered into his ear, \"are you asleep?\" More silence and deep breathing. Norman kissed Sean\"s cheek tenderly and whispered, \"Goodnight\" as he rolled over to be back to back with Sean. Just like they were during the filming of the screen test shots the first day they met. Norman let out one final sigh as he felt himself sinking into unconsciousness. \"You know,\" Norman heard Sean\"s voice say as he partially rose out of slumber, \"I only made a joke about your dick that day because I was nervous. That\"s what I do when I get nervous. I make jokes. And you have made me very nervous from day one. I was attracted to you and it scared me because that had never happened to me with a guy before. I was fighting a hard-on that entire shoot. When your skin was pressed up against mine...God...it was driving me crazy. Last night was beautiful, and for me at least, it was a long time coming.\" Norman opened his eyes, but Sean was positioned behind him and could not see that he was awake. It wasn\"t a dream this time. Last night really happened. He felt Sean get up and leave the bed, and soon after he heard the bathroom door shut. Norman sat up and wrapped a sheet around his lap. As soon as he did, he winced as an unfamiliar pain shot through his nether regions and he had to reposition himself onto one buttock to relieve it. He heard the toilet flush and the sink run before the door opened again and there was Sean. He had put on a pair of cotton pajama pants, but his shirt was still off. \"Mornin\", Reedus,\" he said brightly as he walked to the kitchen, got down 2 cereal bowls from the cabinet and began pouring cereal from a jar that sat atop the breakfast bar. Norman watched as he made his way to the fridge and removed a quart of milk, pouring some onto the cereal. \"Hey,\" smiled Norman softly. \"You want some breakfast? Got some Grape Nuts,\" said Sean, attention on his food, as he sat down and began to eat. \"Sure,\" said Norman as he swung his legs over the side of the bed and started searching for his clothes. He had to move slowly as what he let Sean do to him the previous night was evident in every single one of the movements of his legs or lower body. He located his underwear and jeans, which he threw on without buttoning or zipping them up. He made his way to the breakfast bar with a distinct interruption in his gait, his legs slightly spread, knees slightly bent. Sean glanced up at him as he sat down slowly on the stool directly across from Sean, exhaling as he did so. Sean looked on, eyebrows raised. \"So uh...,\" he began, \"do you remember what we did last night? I was pretty wasted.\" \"Oh really?\" asked Norman. Oh my God! Now\"s my chance to get him back! I know he\"s lying because of what he just said a minute ago about last night! Okay, I have to do this right or it won\"t work, Norman thought to himself. \"No, I don\"t...\" he trailed off, \"I was hoping you could tell me.\" He had the most serious look on his face as he gazed at Sean for an answer. All the color drained from his face. \"Are...are you serious? I was just fuckin\" around.\" \"No...I\"m serious. I remember eating pizza and talking about the nude scene being cut. Next thing I know I\"m waking up naked in your bed. I\"m assuming you slept on the couch, right? What was I doing naked? And why is my ass so sore?\" Norman didn\"t break his lie. It was brilliant. \"Uh...you uh...ah fuck,\" said Sean as his head dropped to the cold tile of the breakfast bar. Norman couldn\"t hold off anymore, it was too funny. He was grinning widely and trying not to laugh. \"Well, well, well,\" he taunted. Sean lifted his head slightly and looked up at Norman, still white as a ghost. \"I wish I had a camera with me to capture this moment,\" Norman continued. \"What moment?\" asked Sean, a look of confusion that we all know as \"deer-in-the-headlights.\" \"Speechless Flanery. It doesn\"t come along very often, but when it does, it\"s a beautiful thing. That\"s for calling my dick little, asshole!\" \"You...you prick!\" exclaimed Sean with a smile as he reached across the table and playfully nudged Norman\"s shoulder, \"oh my God! Good one, Reedus, you really had me goin\"! Jesus Christ!\" Norman laughed gleefully as Sean sat shaking his head and breathing a sigh of relief. \"I heard you this morning,\" Norman said, his laughter stopping, \"before you got out of bed. I heard what you said. I feel the same way.\" Sean looked up and said nothing, only looked into Norman\"s eyes and smiled. He looked angelic as Norman gazed across the breakfast bar at him, eyes locked with Sean\"s. \"Christ, I need a shower. Mind if I take one?\" asked Norman, breaking their stare because it was too intense. \"Go right ahead,\" said Sean, digging his spoon into his Grape Nuts. Norman stepped into the shower and dipped his body under the hot water, closing his eyes. The water felt heavenly as it trickled down his body, but burning as it ran down his ass crack. He was just starting to lather himself up when he felt a set of hands on his back. He jumped at first, but upon turning around his lips met a now familiar kiss. Sean kissed him deeply and passionately as his ran his fingers through Norman\"s hair and kissed up the front of Norman\"s neck, causing him to tilt his head back. It felt strange for Sean to be running his tongue along an Adam\"s apple, but exciting if not even a little forbidden. Sean\"s lips made their way to Norman\"s ear and he whispered, \"Sorry I fell asleep on you last night. That sex was so bomb I just passed the fuck out.\" \"Yeah you did,\" said Norman, lightly kissing Sean\"s shoulder, \"it\"s okay. You can make it up to me some other time...if you want.\" \"How \"bout right now?\" whispered Sean seductively in his ear, \"I put some lube on before I came in here. That\"s why I\"m standing away from the water, so it doesn\"t wash off.\" \"Well aren\"t you clever?\" Norman grinned and kissed Sean deeply again. Sean broke away from the kiss and turned around, pressing his back against Norman\"s chest and grabbing his dick with one hand while reaching up and behind him to grab Norman\"s hair and pull slightly with the other. Norman lightly groaned as he began grinding himself against Sean. \"Mmmm,\" Norman\"s soft, raspy voice vibrated against Sean\"s ear. Sean shifted slightly to get them a little more away from the water and began guiding Norman\"s swollen, solid dick into him. \"You okay doin\" it with no condom? I don\"t have anything,\" he whispered to Norman, who nodded yes. Norman felt as though he would explode with intense pleasure as Sean\"s body accepted him and he sank deeply into him. He pushed forward until he couldn\"t push any further. He was all the way in. Sean titled his head back and rested it on Norman\"s shoulder; eyes closed peacefully, lips parted slightly. \"Why was that so easy for you and not me?\" asked Norman with obvious effort. He was feeling so good it was hard for him to speak. \"Well I didn\"t exactly tell you the truth last night when I said I\"ve never been on the receiving end of something...\" said Sean unobtrusively. Norman snapped out of his ecstasy filled state and stopped thrusting. \"What?\" he asked, \"but I thought you said I was the only -\" \"Oh, don\"t worry. What I said about you being the only guy was true. But uh...this chick I messed with for a while had a thing for using toys on her men...and I let her. And let her. And let her. And hell, then I just liked it. So you know what that means, Reedus?\" \"What?\" whispered Norman into Sean\"s ear, giving it a quick lick. \"That means you can fuck my brains out,\" he replied and thrust hard back against Norman while pulling his hair. Caught off guard, Norman let out a loud moan as he thrust forward as hard and fast as he could, finally the one in control. He pushed Sean\"s arms forward, pinning them against the wall by the wrists. His knees grew weak as he sped up and pushed harder. \"You know,\" said Sean in between deep grunts, \"I thought...that day in your trailer, when I asked you if you wanted me to beg...I thought you didn\"t feel the same way I did...I thought I was wrong. This is one time...mmm...one time I\"m glad to be wrong.\" Norman smiled as he reached around and grabbed a hold of Sean\"s dick that was so hard it was throbbing and started to stroke. \"How so very wrong you were,\" he whispered, pressing his chest against Sean\"s back and biting his ear, along with the skin on his neck and shoulders. He felt himself nearing an orgasm and sped up his hand speed, tugging on Sean\"s dick as hard and fast as he could. \"Ohhh Norman...you feel so good,\" Sean whispered as he reached behind his head again to pull Norman\"s hair, \"fuck me harder.\" Norman thrust back and forth as hard as he humanly could and it wasn\"t long until Sean could feel Norman\"s dick pulsating inside him as he filled him with several warm waves of cum. He felt Norman\"s body shake against his, vibrating in even motions as he undulated into him. This made him cum as well, and he shot five spurts of hot sperm all over the shower wall and Norman\"s hand. Norman felt like he was floating outside his own body as every nerve stood on end and he couldn\"t remember anything other than this moment; being with Sean. As he regained his composure, he turned Sean\"s face toward his and kissed him - a long, passionate, slow kiss. \"One of these days you\"ll have to show me how you hit that one spot last night,\" said Norman as he pulled himself out and climbed under the water to rinse off. \"So there\"s gonna be a next time?\" asked Sean as he turned around. Norman looked at him, dumbstruck. \"I just figured...you\"ve got a girlfriend, you\"re about to have a baby...the movie\"s a wrap...how could we possibly keep this thing going?\" said Sean. Norman thought deeply for a moment before he said, \"Maybe Troy will do a sequel.\" THE END", "\"K-Niner!\" all of Per Force shouted at once. All except Odious, who cocked his head curiously, something else had caught his attention. He was looking around as if he heard something the others did not, his brow crinkled as his brain tried to figure out, working overtime. In his preoccupied confusion, the muscle-bound hound paid no attention to where he was going and slipped in a puddle of his own drool. His antic were unnoticed by his teammates, all of whom were transfixed by the terrible images that flashed across the screen. K-Niner hurled soldiers high above his head like a Olympic javelins left and right, his claws slashing and jaws gnashing as the setting sun glinted almost evilly off his helmet. A diabolical smile was on his face as he plowed through the emperor\"s forces, laughing in demented glee. The look in his eyes was one of pure undaunted delight as two more came at him and were demolished, his head then threw back and howled with rapture. But, if one had listened very closely, they may have noticed that the howl was in fact joining in harmony with another, one much too pure, too erratic, too beguiling to be picked up by any mere communication device. \"But- but how? I thought we already trounced K-Niner!\" Abnermal exclaimed. \"How\"d he get back on two legs?\" \"How else?\" growled Garzooka \"Vetvix just made him smart again, that\"s all.\" Abnermal nodded confidently \"Besides, we\"ve flattened K-Niner into doggie pizza before, we can do it again.\" \"There\"s no need to insult pizza!\" put in Garzooka. However, in the back of everyone\"s mind (except maybe Odious\") despite Abnermal\"s annoying reassurances, remembered what a challenge K-Niner was the last time they encountered him and wondered if they could indeed do it again. Emperor Jon continued, \"And that\"s not even the worst of it. He\"s got help this time, serious help. Someone much more powerful in the dark arts, combat skills, cunning and I\"d hate to think what else.\" \"This is no minion,\" added Binky \"Vetvix didn\"t even create this one. Her name, from what I can gather from witness accounts, is Nefer-tut, a jackal from over five thousand years ago. I assume Vetvix summoned her combining her own dark magic with one from an ancient Kempt ruin.\" \"Kempt?\" asked Starlena. \"An ancient civilization of this universe\" Compooky explained. Images of temples. Stone palaces, and massive pyramids appeared on his monitor, hieroglyphics scrolling along the bottom. \"It is much like the ancient Egypt in our own universe.\" \"Oooh! Like the Wrappings movies? Will there be mummies? And swordfights? And evil magical statues that come to life and step on everyone?\" Abnermal was obviously more than thrilled at the thought of his favorite movie coming to life. \"Mummies?\" questioned Binky \"I doubt it, but I wouldn\"t put it past her. This jackal, you see is not like any other enemy this universe has seen for thousands of years. Nefer-tut isn\"t a servant of Vetvix, in fact it may be the other way around because Nefer-tut...is a goddess. An evil unlike we\"ve ever seen, she must be stopped!\" \"Hey, that\"s my line,\" protested the emperor. \"The army still hasn\"t left Mêlée, you\"ve still got a good chance of stopping this K-Niner and his new friend before they do any more damage.\" \"Obviously. We\"re off.\" Emperor Jon nodded relieved \"Good luck to you Pet Force\". The screen went blank. \"A goddess...\" breathed an awed Starlena. Abnermal nodded in agreement \"Sounds really tough.\" Garzooka crossed his powerful arms with the utmost confidence \"Goddess or not she\"s still on the side of evil and that means this Nefer-tut\"s going down.\" Compooky beeped as a calculation ran through is amazing super-computer brain \"I calculate Pet Force\"s success rate at 95,\" he said as cheerfully as a cyber-bear could. \"There, you see? We\"ll put those pups down no sweat.\" The rest of his teammates nodded in agreement, excluding Odious who was still literally staring into space. \"Now,\" said Garzooka, looking more serious than he ever did, \"We\"ve still got fifteen minutes before we arrive. So...what\"s for lunch?\" AN: Em hotep loyal readers, glad to see you\"re still with us! I was delighted to see such wonderful reviews; it\"s nice to know that people are reading and that they like it. Many apologies for the delay in posting this chapter, but as some of you know this fan fiction somehow got erased. Afterwards, for some reason the stupid floppy wouldn\"t work right and I couldn\"t upload... It\"s a long story. But anyway, it\"s here now. Huzzah. Such is the nature of the world. Life will torture you if you let it. It gives you cancer and injury, but it also gives you beer and butterflies. The world is pure nonsense. Accept that and enjoy the silly ride.\" - James Kochalka; Fantastic Butterflies \" That was disappointingly easy,\" sighed Necrofeere, blue flames spurting casually out his skull. It perched upon what was once a very fine marble statue, now disfigured into some sort of headless, limbless, malformed creature, a casualty of the battle. The undead minion, along with K-Niner, currently lounged in the main hall of what was once the proud and lavish capitol house of Mêlée, now a proud and lavish trademark for the first of what would be many glorious victories of the dark goddess of the sands, Nefer-tut. As he had smugly announced this earlier, the turtle/crow (Wilbur, was it? What sort of name was that for a minion anyway?) pointed out that the seizure of planet Mêlée was a victory for Vetvix, not the jackal. Necrofeere scoffed, skeletal tail lashing furiously at the very notion. As if the Angel of Chaos would ever serve a human! As if a goddess would ever kneel before a mortal sorceress! The very idea was nothing short of blasphemy! In the days of yore, back when things were done right, such a profane tongue would be ripped from the mouth and eaten. And that was if they were very, very lucky. Besides, who was it that led the assault in the first place? Who was it with white fangs gnashing and elated voice laughing slashed through Mêlée\"s forces like soft butter? Who was it with fresh glistening blood on her claws, who was it with the utmost dark and pious elegance took down the emperor\"s military without even one casualty, without even breaking into a sweat? Who was it that now stood with pride atop the capitol building at this very moment, silhouetted by the ivory moon and before thousands petrified citizens looking on in mortal terror, sung a beautiful song of victory to the heavens? Whose enticing voice now rang above the decimated shamble that once was one of the greatest military training planets of all time? Who? Certainly not Vetvix, she was still lounging on her soft ornamental pillows in her fancy room eating gourmet food, looking at what she assumed would soon be hers, waiting for the universe to be simply plopped into her lap to rule over. Waiting to be handed a victory she did not earn. A nasty spurt of blue ember collided with an unfortunate vase. How dare she regard the lady Nefer-tut\"s work in such disregard! How DARE she! The undead creature curled its bony tail around impatient claws as growing malice festered in its nonexistent heart. It was disgusting. If this kind of ignorance was common, there was certainly a lot of cleaning up to do if this universe was to meet the standards of She Who Runs With Shadows. Like the battle this afternoon. What the heck was that? Not even close to a challenge, even the weakest empires of the old age put up more than a fight than Mêlée did. Surely this new age of technology and chrome had more of a fight in it! \"That,\" he repeated, \"Was disappointingly easy\". K-Niner glared at the dragon from a velvet chesterfield as Chirtax, the lizard/gerbil, tended to his bare back. Easy for him to say, that incompetent bag of bones didn\"t do a thing except fly around cackling and setting things of fire. He wasn\"t the one dueling it out with Mêlée\"s finest; after all, it wasn\"t the training planet of the emperor\"s forces for nothing. He wasn\"t the one shot in the lower back. Not only that, but shot with one of the newer models, one with a laser that slashed into the skin. Now, along with the knife wound given to him earlier in the battle, the wound grew larger, an ugly splotch of red and brown, defiling his flawless jet-black fur. The Doberman drew back his ears and winced in pain as iodine was rubbed into his raw, throbbing wounds. Claws drove deep into the cushion, savagely ripping through the fancy material as if it were at the receiving end of some demented surgeon as he convulsed in agony, panting heavily. Chirtax shrunk back fearfully; his furry little gray head seemed to sink into his scaled shoulders as he quickly uttered an apology. Necro snickered viciously and spat a little blue fireball at the gerbil\"s head, blasting the jar of iodine into a thousand shards of glass and ashes. Chirtax squealed and cowered in a shivering little gray ball, whimpering pitifully. His whiskers and fur were singed with black, as he was only centimeters away from complete annihilation. K-Niner lifted a brow, \"I say, that\"s not very sporting of you.\" The dragon grinned evilly, \"I know.\" But the sadistic mood vanished as quickly as it appeared, and Necrofeere once more slipped into its impatient murk. With an irritated lash of his tail he began to pace back and forth upon the green marble floor. \"When the heck\"s these Pet Force fellows \"sposed to show up? Are they even going to come at all?\" The agony cutting into K-Niner\"s back finally began to decline, and he was finally able to take deep breaths again, though his body was still trembling with post-trauma. He glared into the intricate patterns his claws had forcibly carved into what had once been the finest chesterfield on all Mêlée, silent as memories showed themselves in the recesses of his mind. A grim, silent snarl crossed his muzzle. \"Don\"t you worry,\" he said in a voice just above a whisper. \"They\"ll get here. They always do. They\"ll be here...\" Necro shot several puffs of violet smoke into the air tiredly, \"If you say so, helmet head.\" The Doberman ignored him and looked about, an expression of annoyance on his face. \"Where is that blasted tea I asked for?\" Chirtax stared up at him with dark frightened eyes. \"I-I-I don\"t know master K-Niner, sir. It should have arrived by now, shouldn\"t it?\" When the lizard/gerbil didn\"t get a response he began occupy himself with gathering an extra bottle of salve. He silently thanked the powers-that-be K-Niner wasn\"t as sadistic as the clattering dragon skeleton. Chirtax held back a shudder as he stole a glance at the creature. This sort of thing was never meant to walk among the living; it wasn\"t even alive. The only thing that kept it going was pure evil magic, the sort that made empires crumble and brought titans to their knees. He knew this for a fact, the evidence was laying all around him; Mêlée wasn\"t just some run-of-the-mill boot camp, it was probably the finest combat center in all the universe, and yet this magic, this force, had dismantled it in a little less than an hour. It frightened him deeply, and despite the fact he and his peers weren\"t exactly authentic creatures themselves, this creature seemed more than a simple mutation of nature- this thing it was just...wrong somehow. If this undead creature that conjured flames of the underworld could be so easily controlled by this jackal, this Nefer-tut, who knew what other horrors she was capable of? Chirtax wasn\"t eager to find out. Behind him, he could hear the sound of a new set of paws on marble and the warm, rich scent of wine, fresh blood, and lotus blossoms drifted in the air. The fur on the back of his neck and tail began to tingle and stand on end. He gulped hard and focused all his mind on spreading the salve across the evil Doberman\"s back. Speak of the devil... He then wished he\"d had a better choice of words. Perhaps he was better off with Vetvix after all... K-Niner\"s head jolted upright as the dark goddess Nefer-tut entered the decimated throne room, trying his best to ignore the jolting pain racing across his fur. She entered without a word nor acknowledgement, casually leaning on the chesterfield, gazing out into the distance. Necrofeere made a small sound of elation and flew on rotted wings to her ankles, bones rattling happily, spouting little glowing sparks as he danced on his hind legs and grinned, looking like a household pet whose master had returned after a long day. The Doberman frowned; something seemed different about her. For one thing, instead of the brilliant bronze armor she had donned earlier as they charged into the battle of Mêlée, she now wore a long flowing robe seemingly made of the night sky, bright and sparking yet shady and subtle, that hugged her figure and cascaded around her being at the same time as it trailed across the marble floor. Certainly not the attire to be combating in, much less against formidable opponents such as Pet Force. If anything, she looks more prepared to be attending a ballroom dance or awards ceremony. Their opponents were well on their way; surely she could sense them coming? Perhaps it was some Kempt tradition of mockery against them, saying that armor wasn\"t necessary to face off against them, to say that it would be so easy one could even do it in a ball gown. The society of Kempt was a rather satirical one and after all, Nefer-tut was supposed to be the deity of trickery. Maybe it was a ruse. Maybe it was a joke. Or maybe the lady Nefer-tut was just nuts; with her it was near impossible to tell. He licked his nose nervously and cocked his head in curiosity, ears twitching. The jackal noticed this and turned to him with a wagging tail and smiling face. \"Hi!\" she said merrily. And K-Niner just stared, awestruck. She was smiling at him- not evilly, or in mockery- just a modest, genuine smile that spoke of nothing but serene gladness. The thing was, (and this was what made the canine breathless) she somehow pulled this off with an air that was of pure innocence, yet still beguiling and seductive and dangerous. He gulped, a rather large lump forming in his Adam\"s apple. Only moments ago she was storming through Mêlée like a cyclone, a pure, pitiless, destructive, demonic force with no qualms of mercy, nor of innocence of any sort as she tore through the helpless planet. Yet now, not even two hours anon, all traces of malice, of bloodlust, of lust for power, of malevolence, of anything she had so joyously displayed was gone. Completely vanished. The being now standing before him was smiling him with an expression of pure innocent joy, like a small child- the kind that sang about lollipops and rainbows. Beings with such undaunted purity of the soul usually didn\"t go on violent massacres. K-Niner cocked his head to one side. This couldn\"t be the same Nefer-tut. It couldn\"t. How could it be? And yet it was. Such a drastic change of persona was foreign concept to the Doberman; an impossibility. And if this jackal would make the impossible possible, then who knew what else she was capable of? Not exactly sure how to respond to Nefer-tut\"s cheerful response, but knowing he should, he politely smiled back. He also knew that in this situation he, as any other sane mortal being would, should very well be afraid but for some reason wasn\"t. \"Err... hello, lady. You certainly seem in good spirits tonight.\" The jackal\"s head cocked to one side and leaned over K-Niner\"s back, her smile becoming significantly smaller, then vanishing altogether. \"Oh, that can\"t be good.' Chirtax gulped and shut his eyes tightly as he felt the chilling sensation of sweet breath rustling his fur, shivering violently despite the sudden warmth swirling around him. Nefer-tut\"s sharp nose began to sniff and survey the damage done to the Doberman\"s back and how the healing was getting on, rustling the fur of both patient and healer as she did so, and making both feel rather uncomfortable. There was a clicking sound as Nefer-tut pulled away from the injured warrior, and circled once around the chesterfield, a look of mixed concern and disappointment cascading across her face. She clicked her tongue again disapprovingly, \"Well now, this certainly will not do.\" At her disapproving glance, Chirtax squeaked in mortal terror, each strand of fur standing on end, each silvery scale quaking with fear as he shut his eyes tightly and cringed in preparation for the grisly demise surely to come. At this sight, Nefer-tut\"s frown darkened, and a quiet growl came forth in her throat, growing louder with each second that went by. K-Niner looked on at the situation with a growing curiosity. It was clear the lady was quite displeased with the handiwork, but why had she not simply destroyed (or... eaten?) the offending creature? Was this some odd form Kemptian form of torture? The earlier brightness must have been a ruse after all. A sharp bark split the silence and there was a brilliant flash of white as without warning the jackal snapped at the mutant creature\"s face, the fangs missing only by an inch. The gerbil/lizard made the squeaking sound again in both surprise and fear as he fell back onto the cold marbled floor. At this reaction, Nefer-tut gave a yip of exasperation and poked the creature\"s scaled backside with a foot paw. \"You. Healer! Look at me. Open your eyes and look at me!\" A pair of large brown eyes stared at his addressor, eyes filled with terror and in the smallest corners pathetic tears brewed. \"Better. Healer, what is your name?\" The servant gulped, \"I-I am Ch-Chirt-t-tax, O exalted one.\" The jackal leaned down, down, down, until she was at snout level with the healer, \"Well then Chirtax, answer me this: why do you cower like some sniveling coward when you are in one of the greatest fortresses in all the realm? Why do you act as if you are a worm, cringing and crawling on the ground? Show some dignity, Chirtax and stand. Stand with whatever pride and courage is left in your scaly hide.\" With that, a black paw reached down and pulled the frightened healer to his feet. The gerbil/lizard shivered where he stood, hardly daring to whimper, \"For give me, your Dark Eminence, but I am only a servant. I-I\"m supposed to show respect. Isn\"t obedience what you desire?\" \"Yes, but that\"s no excuse for becoming a sniveling lackey. Even lowly fleas carry themselves with some sort of self-worth!\" Chirtax stepped back nervously, trembling on his paws as golden eyes began to glitter wickedly in the capitol building\"s fluorescent light. Now only centimeters from the goddesses\" (and he was sure of this now, for this jackal could be nothing short of a god) jaws, and could feel sweet breath caress his whiskers. The gerbil/lizard gasped as ebon paws again lifted him from the floor and held him in the air as if he were catch of the day. He didn\"t even bother to struggle; her grip was like a vice. \"Chirtax? Dost thou know what I do with frightened minions?\" Her captive fearfully shook his head. \"I give them... a HUG!\" Laughing, Nefer-tut clutched Chirtax to her robe in a joyous squeeze and set him down where he was. K-Niner\"s jaw fell open in shock. Mad this lady was. Completely and totally mad. Necrofeere\"s laugh echoed through the room, \"A grand jest mistress!\" The Doberman ignored him, still staring in shock at the giggling jackal. \"I- you- he- What was that all about!\" Nefer-tut turned to him giggling and twirled in a little jig, letting the folds of her robe flair out and dance in in the air. \"For fun, silly-pants!\" \"For fun? Are you insane!\" \"\"No. Well... not really. Umm... what was I doin\"?\" This time, K-Niner laughed as well. A smile, jovial and bright conquered the goddess\"s face \"There, you are! Laughter\"s the greatest healer there is. Just look at thy spine, warrior who is much too grim. See what laughter has done!\" He looked. The nasty, foul wound festering in his in his perfect ebony pelt had indeed healed. Not only healed, but it was as if the injury had never occurred at all, the wound had vanished completely, along with the agony it had carried. \"But.. How? What did you do?\" Necro spat indignantly \"Dost thou ever listen! The laughter provided the energy necessary to heal thy ungrateful self. \"T\"was all a jest, you domestic twit.\" \"The way you were acting I was certain that servant would\"ve been eaten, or destroyed, or... worse.\" Nefer-tut laughed softly this time, a chime-like sound. \"Now, what would have come of that? I would\"ve lost a fine healer, without him I doubt you\"d be able to walk again. I also suspect Vetvix lacks in medics. To destroy him would\"ve been a tragic folly. He was really the one who fixed your back; I simply decided to use my good mood to speed up the process with a joke. Neat, huh?\" The Doberman smiled weakly. \"I can\"t believe it.\" Necrofeere nodded toward Chirtax, currently passed out on the floor; he\"d fainted dead away. \"From the looks of it neither can he.\" Yes, this was sort of a filler chapter, but it\"s building up to something good. And it\"ll be mighty important later on. Pet Force should be coming into the spotlight next chapter, with a confrontation at hand. Yay!"]}
{"id": "3d529089-2422-5279-8ce0-3028c9da8c45", "fandoms": ["Lemonade Mouth", "Xiaolin Showdown"], "pair": ["I couldn\"t help it. I laughed. She looked at me like I had finally lost it before breaking out a smile herself. \"Oh geez Stell. What a mess we\"ve landed ourselves in.\" I gasped, collapsing on the ground beside my desk, camera still in my hands. She settled down beside me with a hum of agreement. \"I can\"t believe we actually caught it all on tape.\" \"I know. Maybe Scott fiddled with the settings and functions to make sure it\"d appear.\" I murmured, thumbing through the settings as I spoke. A tiny brown hand suddenly gripped onto my wrist, stopping me with a jolt. \"What?!\" \"Scott! Wen! The girls! We, we have to show them this!\" Stella stammered, her eyes frantic. \"I don\"t know about you Charlie, but I feel like my head is going to explode. No wonder we went so catatonic earlier. It\"s too much to process. We need to share this with the others and go through it together. Six brains figuring this out are better than our lazy two...well, one. Combined we\"re pretty much one, useless, petrified brain.\" \"How...uplifting.\" Ignoring my comment she hauled me to my feet, wrestling her phone out of her pocket as she did. I simply set the camera on my desk before turning to pick up my chair, listening as she blabbered out a quick, demanding message to everyone in the band. Sitting down, I reached for the camera again, rewinding the footage so I could watch it again. It still seemed so unreal. A hoax. Maybe I\"d look up and see a camera pointed through the window at me, and Tyron would jump out the bushes, screaming \"Gotcha!' or \"that\"s for trespassing!' But between the still yard and the still shot of the ghost\"s upset face, I knew it was no prank. \"Oh...okay, yep, we\"ll be there soon. Sorry for yelling. Mhm, bye.\" I heard Stella finish her last call before walking back over to me, watching the film over my shoulder. \"Stop watching it. It\"s too damn creepy.\" \"I just want it to all be a hoax.\" She placed a reassuring hand on my shoulder, squeezing it lightly. \"Me too buddy, me too. But for now we have to get our butts over to Liv\"s place. She\"s not well apparently. Nasty flu by the sound of it.\" Sighing I closed the camera and headed out after her, unable to ignore the churning in my gut. I was filled with dread. Something, something, was horribly wrong with this story. \"...Just be quiet around her. She\"s extremely tired and hasn\"t been responding too well to her medicines. She should be resting, but I know there\"s no stopping your little gang.\" Mrs White chuckled as she lead Stella and I towards Olivia\"s room, before frowning as she glanced at us over her shoulder. \"Speaking of sleep, you two look like you\"ve been dragged through hell and back. Do you want me to make you both a warm bowl of tomato soup? Or make up the couches in the den so you can sleep?\" \"You\"re too kind Gram, but no thank you. We\"ll just met with the others then be out of your hair.\" Stella politely refused with a tired, but warm smile. Mrs White smiled sympathetically before pausing to knock on her granddaughter\"s door, interrupting Wen\"s lively tale of some sort. \"Olivia darling, the rest of your friends are here. Do any of you want something to eat or drink?\" A chorus of \"no thanks\" rang around the room, followed by a deep, rattling cough that had us all holding our breath empathically. After one last worried glance, she left the room, closing the door half way behind her. It was then that I finally turned to see Olivia. If I had felt shit before, seeing her I felt guilty for my own self-pity. She was so pale, the veins around her neck and hands a striking blue against her exposed her skin. Her hair was hanging limp around her shoulders, and she was nestled amongst her pillows and blankets, Wen\"s comforting arm draped across her shoulders. She coughed again, before letting out a quick succession of short breaths, wincing. I shuffled nervously in the doorway, unsure as to what to do, but I wanted to help her. She just looked so...helpless. Seeing my look she struggled to smile. \"Summer fevers. Wh-what\"cha going to do?\" she gasped, earning a small, weary smile. \"Um, hey Liv. Sorry to hear about your flu. And sorry in advance guys, but this sombre mood is in for in a sharp decrease.\" Stella finally spoke, shuffling further into the room. Sitting on the edge of the bed, she gathered the others around, explaining as she went. \"So, as you know, the boys have been paranoid about a ghost in the White Crypt for the last week now. I thought they were smoking some serious weed until last night.\" She murmured, rubbing at her eyes tiredly as I started up the camera again. \"I listened in on one of their talks before practice, and found out that Scott had the property under surveillance. So I decided to give Charlie here a fright last night. Liven up his dull guard watch. I got a lot more than I bargained for.\" \"Did you see that hobo again?\" Mohini asked curiously, peering over her arm at the camera I was settling in front of her. \"I wish. I really do.\" She whispered as the footage started rolling. To give them credit, they were all dead quiet while watching. Even after the film stopped and Scott reached out to rewind it to watch it again, they were still silent. For the longest time, no one said anything, as we watched the image of squirrel guts fade to black for a second time. And a third. And again. Finally Wen reached out and snapped the screen back against the body of the camera. \"That\"s enough. So we got proof. Unfortunately that doesn\"t solve anything.\" \"What the hell was that?\" Mohini whispered, lifting her gaze to stare at us in shock. \"That\"s the exact same thing I asked.\" Stella murmured, cradling the camera to her chest carefully. I had never seen her so unsure. None of us had. Without our usual rock, we were a mess. Olivia was twisting her lifeless hair around and around her finger so much I was worried it\"d cut off the circulation. Wen was frowning out the window, absently rubbing circles across her shoulder, every single freckle prominent on his face and neck. Scott was chewing at his lip, blood staining the edge of his mouth. Stella and Mo were huddled together, just staring at the camera. I was suddenly filled with a bucket load of self-loathing. Why did I have to take that shortcut that night? Why couldn\"t I just face Tyron like a man? Why did I have to drag everyone into this? \"Are you children okay in there? You\"ve been awfully quiet for a while now.\" Gram\"s voice broke through the haze of hatred clouding my head, her own poking in through the gap in the doorway. She clicked her tongue in dismay when she saw our current state before shaking her head. \"You all need some soup. You look as if you saw a ghost.\" The cliché line shook the last of the stupor off me. As she disappeared, I jumped to my feet and hurried after her. \"Gram?\" she stopped midway down the hall, looking back at me over her shoulder. \"Thank you. I....just, thank you. For everything.\" She smiled and shooed me away with a flap of her frail hand. \"Go lie down child. I\"ll call you all when the soup\"s ready.\" I smiled in return before slipping back into the room, to find everyone\"s gaze on me. Squaring my shoulders, I snatched the camera from Stella\"s grasp and put it safely away on Olivia\"s desk. \"Right. So first of all, I\"m so sorry guys. If I hadn\"t cut through that property the other night, none of this would be happening right now. But we can\"t turn back time-\" \"As much as I wish we could.\" \"Shhh Wen, Charlie\"s having a dramatic speech.\" \"Shh yourself Mo!\" \"Guys, on a roll here...thank you. Now, as much as I wish I could make this better, I can\"t think of any other way to than by solving this mystery. Yes, mystery. We have proof of a ghost haunting a new construction site. Why? Who were they when they were alive? What happened? When? Who? What with?\" \"Professor Plum, with the candlestick in the kitchen.\" Stella automatically sassed before slapping a surprised hand over her mouth. A wiry grin quirked at my lips as I continued. \"Possibly. But we can\"t be too sure yet. Wen, Scott and I have tried researching the mansion by ourselves these last couple of days, and at the moment, we haven\"t found much out. But I was kinda hoping, that now that you girls have seen the footage, you\"ll be on board with helping us? Olivia\"s good with books, and Mohini you\"re studious. And Stella has connections that I don\"t dare question. Between the three of you, I bet you could dig up far more information than we could.\" There was silence for a moment before Olivia coughed out a reply. \"I-I\"m...on board.\" Mohini hesitated before nodding her consent too. Stella didn\"t need to say anything. I knew she was on board the moment the ghost whispered, \"Find me.\" \"Alright. So, starting tomorrow, we should make a plan on what to do and where to look.\" \"Why tomorrow?\" Wen enquired. \"Dude, I don\"t know about you, but I don\"t think I can focus on much more today. And Olivia looks like she\"s about to collapse due to exhaustion. So does Stella. I think some of Gram\"s soup, and a good day of rest is what we all need after seeing that video.\" \"Yeah, I agree with Charlie. I can honestly tell my Dad now that I won\"t be watching another horror movie for a good, long time.\" Scott sighed, running a ragged hand across his head. \"Come on, let\"s go help Gram with the soup. I could really do with some water as well. Anyone else?\" Fifteen minutes later, Olivia\"s room smelt strongly of tomato soap and stale breaths. Upon her request we opened one of the windows, allowing us all to enjoy the soothing summer breeze. Somehow we managed to turn onto a lighter tone of conversation, talking about how the new school year was only two short weeks away. Wen was the first to leave, groaning about summer homework he still hadn\"t finished. We cooed as he planted a gentle kiss on Olivia\"s pale forehead, happily noting the touch of colour that returned to her cheeks at the contact. Stella left next after a worried phone call from her mother. Scott hurried out after her to her part time job, but Mohini and I stayed, enticing Olivia into games of Go Fish until she fell asleep. Tucking the cards in the tidy pile in her desk draw, Mo tip toed out of the room to meet me in the hall, looking back at our sleeping friend once more before closing the door. \"I\"m worried about her Charlie.\" She whispered as we headed out. \"She really needs to go to the doctors.\" \"Apparently she has already.\" I murmured, \"Gram was telling me and Scott earlier that they were going back again tomorrow afternoon. She\"s worried she picked something up while we were on tour, maybe some weird kind of allergy.\" \"But wouldn\"t that haven shown up straight away?\" \"I dunno. I\"m no doctor. But it could be anything.\" ...Really. If only I had known then. If only I had known when I waved goodbye to Mrs White and Mohini and headed home. If only I had known as I slept throughout the rest of the day and dinner. But when Mum came bursting into my room in the middle of the night, clutching the phone to her chest, tears streaming down her face, the part of me that had known woke up. And it cried. And cried, and cried. The trip to the hospital was awful. I sniffed back more tears and snot in that short fifteen minute drive than I had as a baby. My legs felt like jelly as I stumbled out of the car in my slippers and robe, vaguely flashing back to a mere 24 hours earlier as I had dashed to help another of my troubled friends. We found them huddled together in the lobby, all looking as ridiculous I did, but we didn\"t care about that. All we cared about was open arms, reassuring hugs and crying over our fallen friend. August 18th 2011 I can\"t remember the last time I went to a funeral. Mum says that I attended a few when I was a kid, but you\"d think you\"d remember the tears. Or those hollow, lifeless eyes of the family members and loved ones of the deceased. I had never seen Mrs White look so lost before. Earlier, everyone was crowding around her, offering sympathy and support, but she\"d rather latch onto the photo of Olivia she was carrying around in her hand. Fidgeting with my tie, I looked around the packed church, surprised at how many people had attended. From the looks of it, the crowd spilled out onto the pavement with their grievance cards and floral reefs. How many actually knew Olivia though? Did these people really know that she would be cringing at the sight of her face plastered everywhere and that she\"d be blushing with gratitude and self-consciousness at the touching speeches? Judging by how they casually dabbed at their eyes or nodded solemnly at every \"She loved\" moment, I\"m guessing no. \"Charlie, sit still.\" Stella whispered from my right, nudging me in the ribs. \"I\"m sorry, but it\"s just-\" \"I know, I know. But you have to sit and bear it. We\"ll have a proper farewell for her soon.\" Grumbling I sunk further into the pew, glaring at the man drawling on about our dear friend. I knew we had fans, and I respect them as they respect us, but these people, the ones that barge in and spread false tales about our beloved, cold just shove it. I must have muttered the last bit aloud as the rest of the band suddenly shuffled guilty around me, their support radiating. In my life, I\"ve received two world changing phone calls. Well, maybe three. But that first time, I remember with fondness; my hands starting to shake as Wen shouted at me, abandoning the phone in search of the closest radio remote, Mohini and Stella yelling at me to explain myself, the crackle of static then finally, the pure sound of our first hit song blasting along the airwaves. We celebrated all night, dancing around my house and the street, shouting that we were going to be famous, that we\"re going to the top, and that nothing could stop us. The second life changing phone call came weeks after, saying that our tour was set and booked, but that third one... Funnily enough, my actions were similar. Shaking hands, abandoning the phone, searching and shouting for my family. But there was no celebration this time. Mum hadn\"t even pulled into the car park at the hospital properly before I was tripping out the door, running into the lobby in my pyjama filled glory, straight into the mournful embrace of my friends. When the doctors finally came to tell us we could see the body, it had taken us some time to gather up the courage to walk into that room. Wen refused. I think to this day he hasn\"t seen her. I don\"t think he regrets it though. I do. Seeing her pale, pale corpse on the metal autopsy table, cold and unwelcoming like the real Olivia will haunt me to my final breath. If I was Wen, I\"d rather remember my final look as the one of her ill in bed, but smiling, not that robotic figure. Especially now that they\"ve conducted the autopsy. We had gathered together with Mrs White and her son to hear the final findings. What we had thought had been the flu gone bad had really been a spontaneous pneumothorax, or in layman terms, a collapsed lung. The medical team had informed us that collapsed or punctured lungs could happen at random, sometimes caused by an erupting cyst on the lung, which was the case with Olivia. They tried to assure us that there would have been nothing we could have done to prevent it, but it was that unspoken \"but you could have prevented her death\" that haunted us all. The man was still droning on. People were starting to tire from his speech, so with some successful shuffling, the minister managed to stop him and invite someone else up to speak. None of us had said anything yet, and I think it was because we couldn\"t bear to do it alone. But also, the memories we had with her were exactly that; ours. We shared enough with the press, why should we keep on letting them in? \"No one else?\" I half expected that to be Stella\"s calling. If anyone was going to say something, it\"d be her. Surprisingly, it was Mohini who stepped forward. We watched in stunned, supportive silence as she slowly pulled herself towards the casket, where she paused to stroke it lovingly before turning to face the crowd. With a small cough, she began to speak. \"Inside this wooden box, this...\"vessel to the afterlife\", lies a dear friend and sister. She would hate for it to be called anything less. \"Something poetic\" she often quoted to me, and something poetic she\"ll get. We often ask why things happen, usually putting it down to \"reasons\". But yet, we still demand answers. The thing is, as much as we try, we can\"t explain everything. And sometimes, we never can. The reason behind Olivia\"s passing might be because of her unfortunate lung injury, but the explanation as to why now will never be answer. Poetic enough for you Liv?\" She paused to give what sounded like a hiccupping sob, but she remained strong, not letting her tears escape. \"Olivia was amazing. She was talented, she was beautiful, and she had a smile that just warmed your soul. She wouldn\"t want to see everyone in tears and mourning. And as a cliché as it sounds, I know that she\"s with her mum, watching over us all. She\"d want us to smile, to rejoice the life she led, and the accomplishments she made. She broke through her shy exterior and enveloped us all into her life. I speak on the behalf of the band when I said she was a sister. Maybe with the exception of Wen, but she loved us all. I remember the last time I saw her. She was smiling, and encouraging, and letting me win in a game of cards that she was clearly better at. I think of her fondly, and from now on, whenever I\"m sad or angry at the world, or feeling like I just can\"t go on, I\"ll remember her, and that last moment. Her with that signature Olivia White smile, her helping hand and her encouraging teasing. And I\"ll smile. Because,\" she broke off suddenly, choking on the tears she had vainly been trying to stifle, \"Because she is my bestfriend. And my world just isn\"t right without her.\" I was too shocked to move. Well, I was moved to the point where I could feel a steady stream of tears running off my chin. But I couldn\"t make my jellified legs move in order to rush up with the others to comfort Mohini. While they smooshed her in an over bearing hug, I sat in my seat, looking like an emotional idiot. Until I felt the weight of everyone as they moved the huddle back to the pews, pulling me in as well. I don\"t remember much more of the funeral. There was a slideshow, some more speeches and then the casket was carried out to the hearse, while we stayed seated, never letting go of each other. I\"m thankful no one bothered us, even after the funeral was well and truly over. We didn\"t go to see her being buried, I think that would have just tipped us even further over the breaking point, we just sat and took comfort from one another. Finally, when the church was empty and we had stopped crying for the time being, Stella let out a rattled sigh. \"We need to talk guys. The press was knocking on my front door this morning as we were getting ready to leave, demanding to know what had happened.\" \"Seriously?!\" Scott growled, \"Those bloody jerks!\" \"I know, I know, cool it man. I dealt with them.\" Stella reassured him before huffing, \"but we can\"t keep them out of the loop forever. I\"m just glad they didn\"t crash the funeral. Well, at least, I don\"t think they did. But rumours are flying and there\"s all this talk that her death wasn\"t an accident, and-\" \"THEY WHAT!?\" Someone once told me that you go through seven stages of grief, and I think that as a band we were showing clear signs of them all. While I was personally still sitting on the denial/in shock stage, Wen had progressed to stage 3; Anger. \"They have no right, n-no respect! No reason as to go around, assuming shit like that!\" \"Wen,\" \"How could they think that? How could they say that? Olivia is barely in the ground and-and they\"re suggesting...?\" He continued to rant, choosing a few choice but very inappropriate words to describe how he was feeling, kicking a few pews in the process. We watched and waited for him to cool down enough to drag him back to his seat, the girls-will, Mo- cooing sympathetically as he continued to rage. Stella leaned back in her seat, rubbing her temples as Scott and I shuffled uncomfortably, not knowing what to do. \"This why I\"ve avoided telling you until now. But we need to do something. So, I was going to arrange a press conference; clear this issue up once and for all. Are you guys in?\" \"I\"m in,\" Scott agreed, drumming his fingers thoughtfully, \"I\"d rather tell them the truth then for them to hear it from a \"close source\".\" \"I agree with Scott.\" I murmured, \"Mo? Wen?\" They just nodded to which Stella sighed. \"Okay then. Will you be okay to do it tomorrow?\" \"Make it today.\" Surprised we looked towards Wen warily, but he seemed to be serious. \"I rather it be today. I don\"t think I can keep my cool until tomorrow.\" \"Um, okay, just let me make a few calls...\" \"Wait.\" I interrupted, a thought just dawning on me, \"They\"re not just going to ask about her death. They\"re going to ask what her passing means for us, as a band. What are we going to say?\"", "Looking up from said phone at Clarice\"s shout, the young man yelled back a negative, before listening as she huffed in annoyance, resuming her search elsewhere in the house. Chuckling, he turned back to his txt, thumb flying over the keys. He was in good spirits. Only three more days until the end of work and he could already picture those sweet, sweet waves. And the sun warmed sand. Ohhh, and the beach, free of the summer tourism. Sighing wistfully Raimundo looked at the phone vacantly, already transported to his favourite surfing spot. \"Raimundo! I know you have my phone!\" Aaaand, he was back. Grumbling he finished his txt to Kimiko, warning her not to txt back for a bit before shoving the phone in his work shoes, knowing Clarice would never search there. \"I told ya, I don\"t have it!\" he yelled back, only to hear her storming up the hallway towards him. \"Then where the hell is it? I haven\"t seen it for days now, and I just know you have it. It\"s like an itch I just can\"t scratch.\" She growled, stretching out the end of her sentence threateningly. Keeping his expression blank, Raimundo stepped aside and invited her into his room with a flourish of his hand. \"Feel free to look around. But I\"m warning you, I don\"t have your stupid phone.\" She looked at him carefully before haughtily stepping through the doorway, her eagle eyes looking for a place to start. He settled for leaning in the doorjamb, amused when she started with his work gear first. Like he suspected, she took one sniff of his shoes before withdrawing quickly, readily turning to another hiding spot. As he continued to watch her hunt, his thoughts drifted back to Rio. He needed to resume looking for a proper job while he was there, one that was close to the sea but preferably didn\"t require him to be gutting fish all day, every day. Maybe there was an equipment hire store that was looking for employees. He could always extend his mentoring business, but that required a lot of effort and starting costs for advertisements, starter surfboards, wax, repair kits; it was a lot to consider in the long run. And then, if he did find a job, there was all the loose ends to tie up here. Quitting his job at the factory wouldn\"t be hard and he was easily replaceable. Packing shouldn\"t be too difficult, though it might require some time to move everything. And he could also hire another car or a truck. No, in fact, the move would be easy. The only thing that was really holding him back was- \"Gah, I can\"t find it. You sold it didn\"t you, you little brat.\" -His family. Narrowing his eyes at his older sister he snorted in disbelief. \"And just why would I do that?\" \"I don\"t know. Because you\"re greedy and wanted more money? You tell me.\" She huffed. A little peeved at the old excuse, Raimundo straightened up and gestured for her to get out. \"Piss off.\" \"Why don\"t you?\" \"You know perfectly why I can\"t. Now get out of my room.\" He snarled, moving towards his bed. \"My house, my room. Now, where the hell is my phone?\" \"I don\"t know okay?!\" he shouted before flopping back on his bed, \"Jeez.\" \"Someone obviously isn\"t getting any.\" Clarice sneered causing him to freeze. That was a low blow, even for her. And she was supposed to be the one sibling he got along with the best. Turning to face her slowly, his glare didn\"t really match his tone. \"And why do you think that is hmm? Maybe because I work 24/7? Do you even know what it\"s like to work? Do you even know what a job is?\" he hissed, noting with some satisfaction at the wince that flashed across her face. \"Don\"t you lecture me about a job little boy. You rode on the coattails of life for long enough and now this is you paying it back.\" \"How? By paying for both our living expenses and sending money across the country to everyone else? They can all go out there get jobs as well. I don\"t see how it\"s my responsibility to be their caretaker.\" He snapped, sitting up again as Clarice smirked slightly. \"You ran away. So, you get to pay.\" \"I didn\"t want to continue living in that...circus.\" \"So you ran to Laguna? What a rebel Rai, what. A. Rebel.\" There was a moment of tense silence between the two siblings before Raimundo sighed tiredly, leaning back on his hands as he stared at the ceiling. \"You know why I ran away Clare. I mean, you followed me.\" He murmured sadly. Clarice\"s stance softened, a look of guilt washing over her. \"Yeah, but that doesn\"t change anything Rai. I mean, I already had a job and a home to call my own before I left. You just, vanished.\" \"And I\"d do it again.\" He said, fixing her with a levelled look. Seeing her arch an eyebrow in disbelief he felt urge to strengthen his resolve to find a new job and leave. \"I will! I was sick of everything then, and I\"m still sick of it. I just needed my space.\" \"Why? Ma and Pa always dotted on you. You were the youngest. You got everything you wanted while the rest of us had to work for it.\" She muttered before looking away sulkily. \"I had that once. Then you brats came along and snatched it from me.\" \"Clare, I-\" \"No pity.\" She snapped before pinching the space between her eyes, \"No pity. I didn\"t mean it that way Rai, it\"s just, sometimes, I mean, our family...\" He watched her struggle to express how she felt, smiling softly in understanding. \"It\"s too complicated for words.\" \"Aye,\" she grinned sadly, \"Too complicated.\" Before he could say anything she reverted back to her original anger and stormed towards the door, warning him over her shoulder that she\"d kill him if she found him with her phone. Watching as his door slammed close, Raimundo couldn\"t help by to grin as well before waiting for her foot steps to fade away. Jumping off his bed, he dived for the hidden phone, pleased to see Kimiko hadn\"t txt him during the argument. After alerting her that he was back, he got to his feet and headed over to the tiny window, overlooking the street. Watching a group of sour looking teenagers were milling around an over flowing garbage can, which was suspiciously smoking, he pondered over everything that had just happened. It was about time he got serious about leaving. Tubarão may have held a good life for him once upon a time, but now, he felt like he was being called elsewhere. Somewhere with good surf, beaches and warmer weather- The phone in his hand bleeped pleasantly and he grinned at the welcome back message Kimiko had sent him. -And, maybe a place with new friends. Heels clicking as she walked down the hallway, she jangled through the dozens of keys absently, listening with a smile to her companion. \"They really said that? Ha, and you...you didn\"t! Oh wow, did they run for the hills?\" She paused for a moment, holding up a particular key for closer inspection, phone cradled between her ear and shoulder, before dropping it back onto the ring with a laugh. \"Oh how I hope you got pictures! To see those bloody tycoons running with their tails between their legs, it\"s just perfect.\" Glancing at her surroundings, she did a quick count of the apartment numbers before swivelling on her heel, back tracking a few doors. Searching through the keys again, she located the right one, humming in response to whatever was being whispered in her ear as she unlocked the door. Shushing them for a moment, she stuck her head in, checking the neatly lined shoes and slippers before slipping inside. Closing the door with a soft snap she locked it again, resting on the frame as she tried to hear if anyone was in the house. A quiet murmur by her left ear made her jump guilty, before she realised it was her phone. \"Shhhh Clay! I\"m trying to figure out if Kimi\"s home or not.\" She hissed, kicking off her shoes, courteously lining them up next to the wall. Clay mumbled something to her as she located a pair of slippers in her size, making her scowl. \"Oh hush. I\"m not breaking any rules or nothing. I\"m just...surveying.\" She explained as she trudged through the pin clean living room towards her friend\"s bedroom, checking the couch and armchair along the way. \"She\"s been out of sorts lately, and I want to know why. And before you ask in that Texan drawl of yours, \"why don\"t ya just ask her yerself\"- hey, I thought that was a pretty good impression thankyou- I have tried asking her. But she just gets this distant look in her eyes and- hold up.\" Peering into the dark room, she took note of the unslept in bed, frowning. The room itself looked like no one had been there in days. \"Weird. Hey, I\"m going to put you on speaker. Wait a moment.\" Removing the small device from where it had imprinted itself against her neck, Keiko tapped a couple of functions as she stepped back into the living room. Settling the phone beside her on the desk, she began opening draws, hunting for anything that might hint towards Kimiko\"s strange behaviour, still yakking away to Clay as she did. \"Ok, so lately when you ask her about what\"s been going on in her life, she gets this weird look in her eye and then goes back to clicking away at her phone. It\"s like it\"s glued to her hand or something. This past week, I haven\"t seen her without it nearby.\" \"But she\"s always got her phone Kei. Especially with this whole trip you said they\"re planning, she\"d need to have it nearby.\" Clay\"s static response rang through the silent apartment as she slumped into a chair, pulling a draw out to rest on her lap. \"Yeah, usually. But I\"m telling you honey, this is different. She smiles and it\"s a happy smile, not her medication influenced one or her strained \"I\"m worked to the bone\" one either. It\"s truly...happy.\" \"And she can\"t be happy?\" He pointed out as she thumbed through a stack of papers. \"No. I mean, yes. I mean...\" she trailed off, blushing guilty as he chuckled lightly. Giving the phone a dirty look she resumed her searching muttering, \"She\"s allowed to be happy, but lately it\"s like she hasn\"t had anything to be happy about. She\"s been so busy with work and the last time I saw that smile was when I suggested she take some leave and go see you. Wait, you haven\"t been talking to her have you?\" \"Now, now Keiko, you know that you monopolise all my time-\" \"Oh shut up.\" \"-But no, I haven\"t heard from her.\" There was a thoughtful pause which had her turning fully to her phone, attention captured. \"You thought of something.\" \"How could you tell?\" \"Please honey, I know you. Now, what\"s on your mind?\" He sighed deeply and she could just picture him rubbing small circles against his brow as he settled back in his old chair. \"Has she...met anyone lately?\" Frowning Keiko drew another stack of papers towards her. \"You mean, as in a guy?\" \"Yeah. A boy.\" \"A boy?\" \"A boy. Or maybe a girl. Dunno which way she swings.\" He chuckled, earning a grin from Keiko. \"But, it could explain why she\"s so happy.\" \"My little Kimiko has a \"friend\"!\" She squealed, before dropping the file she was holding. \"Oh shit! Kimiko has a \"friend\". Clay, she hasn\"t made a new friend since you! Oh gods, we could be on the edge of potential disaster. What if they find out about her mental state and dump her ass! Or, or what if they\"re just using her? What if, they force her to do something that could harm her?\" \"Woah, woah, slow down sugar! Keep that up and I\"m going to have to get Kimiko to share her meds with you.\" \"Not funny.\" \"Take a deep breath and relax and it won\"t be. Now, calm down. We don\"t know anything at this point in time. And you\"re going to have to be subtle when asking her. Can you do that? Cause, I know you\"re not the best at being tactical.\" \"One time! It was one time and I thought you\"d let that go by now!\" \"I\"m never going to. But focus sugar! This could be a good thing. Like you said, the last person she made friends with was me. She may try to deny it, but we really are her only true friends. We need to go about this carefully. Don\"t scare her off them. Let her tell you when she\"s comfortable about talking about it.\" \"But Clay,\" she whined. \"No buts. Now-\" he stopped suddenly, and she heard a chair scrap across the ground roughly before a string of accented swears. \"Clay honey? What\"s wrong?\" \"They\"re back.\" She paled, fumbling to pick up her phone. Turning it off speaker, she held it close to her, feeling like she was closer to him as she did. \"Clay, settle down. Don\"t let them see you angry. We\"ve talked about this remember?\" \"I\"m gonna find my Daddy\"s gun, and shot those buzzard bastards right off my front stoop.\" He growled in response, and she could hear him hunting through the cupboard. \"Clay, stop! You do that and you\"ll attract more remember? Buzzards are attracted to dead meat.\" He cursed but stopped riffling around. \"Good. Now, do you breathing exercises....good. Now, when they knock on the door, tell them civilly that you\"re still not accepting their offer.\" \"What if they produce legal documents?\" \"Then scan them and send them to me. I\"ll get someone over here to help go over them.\" \"Thanks sweetheart, but I don\"t think Japanese laws apply over here.\" She smiled at his light chuckle. \"True, but surely it\"s the same language. We can help.\" \"You\"re the best, you know that?\" \"I know.\" She heard a knock from his end, and he cursed again before taking a deep breath in. \"Listen, I gotta go. Say hi to Kimiko for me will ya? And tell me what happens.\" \"And the same to you. Love you. Good luck.\" She murmured. \"Love you too sugar. And thanks.\" With that he hung up, leaving her to sit in a silent apartment. Sighing raggedly, she pocketed her phone before returning the files and draw to their rightful spot. Checking the time, she headed towards the kitchen, flicking on the kettle, before hunting through the cupboards. A few minutes later, just as it shrilled loudly, the front door clicked open, revealing a dishevelled looking Kimiko. \"Hey.\" \"I should have known you\"d be here.\" She sighed, unlacing her shoes. \"Don\"t act like you don\"t appreciate it. Here, I made you some tea.\" Keiko offered her a steaming mug which she accepted with a quiet thanks before trooping over to her couch. Plopping down with an exhausted \"oomph\" she closed her eyes as Keiko finished bustling around her tiny kitchen, eventually making her way over. Sitting down beside her, she trailed a critical eye over the younger girl. Her pony tail was limp and barely secure, tendrils of hair hanging around her ears. She cheeks were flushed while the rest of her was paler than usual. She could see the pronounced veins along and around her eyes. She was shaking slightly, her cup quivering in her grasp. Gently prising it from her hands, Keiko set it on the table before reaching behind her for the quilt she always kept nearby. Flicking it out, she draped it over the quiet girl, motherly tucking the stray strands of hair off her face. \"You\"re not going to work tomorrow.\" This made Kimiko\"s eyes snap open in protest, but Keiko held up a hand to stop whatever argument was brewing. \"You need some rest Kimiko. I saw your room. Have you even slept here for the last few nights? Have you slept at all? Cause frankly, you look like shit.\" Kimiko shuffled sheepishly in her seat, before murmuring a small, \"No.\" \"You\"ve been at work haven\"t you?\" \"Yeah. I got a couple hours of sleep in the breakroom this morning, and I cleaned myself up in the restroom. Used some wet wipes. But I had to get this new computer programme installed, and then there\"s that bloody paperwork.\" She trailed off, muttering under her breath about killing all photocopiers, printers and fax machines, unconsciously pulling her phone out of her pocket as she did. It was silent for a moment as she tapped away, a smile settling on her lips as Keiko watched her with narrowed eyes. \"You\"re not going to work.\" Faster than Kimiko could say \"What?' her friend had pounced, trapping her in the quilt as she snatched for her phone. Struggling against her, she held the cell as far away as she possibly could, but Keiko just crawled over her, nearly kneeing her in the face as she did. Clamping her hands around Kimiko\"s smaller one, she prised her fingers apart as if she were the Jaws of Life, catching the falling phone expertly. Pinning her still struggling friend, she swiped off the safe lock on screen before starting to hunt through her contacts for work. Well, she was going to when something else caught her attention. One new message from \"Raimundo\" \"Kimi...\" Just her tone told her what Keiko had read. Thrashing about she tried to reach around the quilt for her phone, but the older girl just held it further away. \"Who\"s...Ai-moon-doe?\" She asked, struggling with his name. \"None of your beeswax.\" \"Is this who you\"ve been txting non-stop this week?\" Keiko gasped, flicking through the read txts in bemusement. \"It\"s none of your beeswax.\" \"Oh my...for the love of high end jewellery! Kimiko! When did you meet this guy? When did you make a friend?\" she gushed excitedly, turning to the now pissed Japanese girl beneath her. \"Get off me, and I might tell you.\" Hurrying to obey, Keiko scrabbled to the far end of the couch, holding the phone tightly to her chest, waiting eagerly for the story. \"Give me my phone.\" \"Not a chance.\" \"Then it\"s none of your damn beeswax.\" Debating it carefully for a moment, Keiko sighed and relinquished the phone with a grumble. Kimiko pocketed it safely before sighing tiredly, wondering where to start. \"Remember how I got those strange txts and I freaked?\" at Keiko\"s cautious nod she mumbled, \"I lied when I told you they hadn\"t txted back.\" \"Kimiko...\" \"I know, I know, bad. But, I was so surprised, I just responded, and then he responded, and then...well, we talked. For ages.\" She smiled, thinking back to their first joking conversation. \"It was fun. They brightened my day and I enjoyed the challenge of coming up with a quick witted reply.\" \"But the txt...\" \"Was a prank. Raimundo told me that he\"d seen this quote on the internet...something about txting a random number \"I\"m pregnant\" when bored and seeing what happens in response. Raimundo typed in my number- had no idea that it actually existed- and voilà! The beginnings of a fantastic friendship.\" She let Keiko have a moment to process it all, mentally preparing herself for any of the most likely outcomes. She wasn\"t overly disappointed when she began to shake her head...just mildly pissed off. \"Kimiko, you can\"t keep txting \"Raimundo\". If that\"s even their name.\" \"But-\" \"No. When you got that txt, I told you to ignore them Kimiko.\" \"Kei, I like this guy.\" \"How do you even know if it\"s a guy?\" \"Well-\" \"What if it\"s just some perv? What if it\"s a scam Kimiko? You can never trust anyone on the internet or by phone these days. Besides, if this guy is truly who he says he is, what are you going to do? Just txt all the time until one of you gets bored? Don\"t tell me you\"re actually arranging to meet up. Remember, stranger danger!\" \"Are you finished yet?\" Kimiko butted in angrily, surprising the older girl. \"I know all about the dangers of the internet and txting and scamming Keiko. I was brought up around more technology than NASA. And I trust this guy. No, we haven\"t arranged to meet or anything. We\"ve just been txting. Nothing more, nothing less. What more do you want?\" \"For you to stop txting him! You freaked out when he first did. You asked me what you should do then, and I\"m telling you same thing now. Ignore it! Take my word for it! It\"s going to end badly. \" \"And you also told me not to take your word to seriously.\" Kimiko bit back, causing Keiko to flinch. \"I don\"t see what\"s so wrong with me making a friend.\" \"Kimi-\" \"And personally, I think you\"re being a bit hypocritical here.\" She continued snippily. Seeing her confused look she huffed and sneered, \"Clay?\" \"That\"s different.\" \"How is it? Have you meet him?\" \"Well, no, but-\" \"A few years ago he was just a random number. Yet you talked to him all the time. And apparently you still do. So why can\"t I talk to Raimundo?\" \"Cause I know that Clay is an honest person.\" \"And how do you really know that? Just because he helped me that one time doesn\"t mean anything. You wouldn\"t have known him any better if you hadn\"t talked to him. And I support your friendship! Why can\"t you support mine?\" Stunned, Keiko sat and stared at the distraught girl, trying to find the words to explain herself. Wiping an arm across her face, Kimiko sighed shakily before murmuring, \"I think it\"d be better if you left.\" \"Kimi.\" \"Leave.\" Heart breaking, Keiko slowly gathered her gear together, sending one last look to her best friend who refused to look away from her still steaming tea cup, before slipping on her shoes and out of the apartment. Once Kimiko was sure she was long gone, she sighed and collapsed in on herself allowing herself to sniffle. She could understand everything Keiko had tried to get through to her, but she was stubborn by nature. Picking up her phone, she lazily dialled work and left them a message that she wouldn\"t be in tomorrow, before scrolling through her past conversations with Raimundo. They had once brought her happiness during her stressful day, but now, all she saw was longing and fabrication. As she opened the message from earlier half-heartedly, she couldn\"t help but to smile at the perfect translation for once. Good morning sunshine! She didn\"t care what Keiko thought, she realised as she settled back against the armrest. Let her judge all she wanted, but Kimiko was on to something here. Good evening! So, listen...I\"ve got this holiday coming up..."]}

He forced an easy grin, knowing it wasn\"t easy to pull one over on his brother. But he had to try. Truth be told, the man was still on edge from watching his father die, and now seeing his brother soaked in his own blood brought the fear of loosing him as well rolling up to the surface in waves that were almost nauseating. \"I got ta get rid of yer blood less you want the cops knocking at yer door. Ya know we don\"t have much help left with ta boys in blue and its mighty hard ta clean up after ya when yer still drippin\" on the fuckin\" floor.\" There was a pause while Murphy seemed to weigh out what Connor was saying. The death of their father pressed down on both the boys the same way and made it hard for either to want to loose sight of the other for even a short moment. But Connor\"s words rang true. They had to neutralize the blood trail with Smecker and Bloom gone for the moment and the longer and more blood he poured out onto the hardwood, the better chance of another fuck up they had. \"Alright, but hurry it tha fuck up. This hurts like fuckin\" hell and I don\"t want ta be standing out in the cold all night.\" Murphy finally conceded and allowed Romeo to usher him outside. Connor raised a hand, shoving it through his hair as he looked at the scattered bodies. Not something they hadn\"t done before, but this time they hadn\"t been expecting it. Though something was gnawing at the back of his mind, like a small fact that they\"d forgotten or hadn\"t picked up on. Still, he set about to cleaning, spraying his brother\"s blood tracks with the fine mist of ammonia. \"Fuckin\" eight of them.\" He muttered to himself as he worked. \"Like we\"re fuckin\" Superman or somethin\". We only wanted the one bastard we thought was upstairs, not the whole lower...\" That\"s when it hit him, the something that was wrong. As they\"d walked up, the shadow. It had been moving still in the upstairs window. Not one of the wise guys down here. They wouldn\"t have been fast enough to make it down here with a warning. And there had been no warning. That was easy enough to tell by the shocked pause when they\"d kicked in the door. Anyone that had a warning to their coming would have been shooting before the splinters of the door hit the ground. That meant there was still one Italian milling around the house. \"Oh fuckin hell!\" He barked, pushing to his feet with sudden realization that he was now alone in the house with whatever wop would want revenge for the group that had been fallen already. But before he could make it fully to his feet, something cracked against the back of his head, a splitting pain roaring through to encompass the entirety of his skull and bring him down, slumping in his brother\"s blood on the floor as darkness gripped him, giving him only the finally words spoken in a thick Italian accent. \"Take him out the back and then finish it.\" Murphy leaned heavy on Romeo\"s shoulder just at the end of the driveway. They were out of sight of the neighbors, but still with a clear view of the house. Despite the waves of pain and dizziness that was washing over him, something was gnawing at his stomach, making him uneasy and jittery, something not normal for the taller of the brothers. \"He\"s got ten more fuckin minutes and then I\"m going in there and draggin him the fuck out myself.\" he muttered, pushing off Romeo and squaring off his shoulders with a pained grunt, ready to make good on his threat. \"Easy there killer, I\"m sure he\"s fine. You left a lot of fucking blood in there and he\"s gotta clean it up or some CSI sort of shit.\" Romeo was already searching his pocket for a pack of cigarettes, unwilling to admit to the agitated Irish man that he was uneasy as well, instead offering him a cigarette as well. Murphy snagged the thin stick, shoving it between his lips enough to catch a glimpse of the tattoo there. His hands searched for his lighter as he glanced up at the house one last time. It was too much, too long. Ten minutes was enough time for the bastard to be in there on his own. \"Fuck it, I\"m gonna get his ass.\" he grumbled, flicking the flint to light up the tip of the cigarette as he took a step back up towards the house, Romeo already moving to chase after him. And then it happened. It was so sudden that at first neither man was sure it really had occurred. The house that had once been standing before them, full of the bodies of eight dead Italian mobsters seemed to go deadly silent before pushing out with an explosion that rocketed such force, it seemed almost to have no sound. Shock waves crashed out, knocking Murphy and Romeo back off their feet. It wasn\"t until their bodies hit the ground that sound finally caught up, roaring over them with a matching heat from the fire, tearing at their very flesh and head like a living being. There was a scream, and at first Murphy thought it was from Romeo. He didn\"t realize it was his own choked cries. \"Connor!\" Now his brain caught up with his own screeching, struggling and flopping on the ground in a dazed manner. The wound on his shoulder had torn more, opening another stream of blood on the pavement that he wasn\"t even aware of. All he knew was that his brother had been in the house that was now raining debris on the neighborhood, the shattered frame licking with fire. \"God, no! Connor!\" Romeo\"s arms where there, grabbing at him even as the distant sound of fire sirens seemed to come from no where, creeping up closer on the duo that was trying to make an escape. Romeo fought with the tearing Irish man, knowing that they could not be caught here. Still Murphy struggled back with a vengeance, screaming as unknown tears tracked down his face, rosary beads bouncing against his chest as their friend started to drag him off. Murph was near hysterics, sure his brother had been caught in that explosion, so much so that the bright light of the fire never seemed to leave his eyes, even as Romeo managed to carry him off from the scene. All Murphy could see was the spot his brother had just been, consumed by the very fires of hell. \"Connor!\" -And there you have it, chapter one. I hope you like it. Click the button and review! Tell me what you think I\"m hoping to have another update out very shortly! 3 -So here\"s the second installment. Sooner then I thought but I can\"t even really sleep due to medication from surgery. Yeah, I know, lucky me. But here you go. Time to find out what really happened to Connor and how Murphy and Romeo are taking what they see as a tragedy... -Thank you to those that reviewed and/or read :D I hope to hear more of what the readers think with where this story is going! Evil Angel Chapter Two: I\"m All Alone \"I\"m on the floorBattered and boredYou got a tasteI can\"t ignoreI\"m all aloneOut in the cold\" -Breaking Benjamin \"Sugarcoat\"- \"Let me go Rome! Let me fuckin\" go! I got ta get him! I got ta go back for him! Connor!\" Romeo refused to let Murphy go, despite the fact that the Irish man was fighting him like a doused cat. All claws and spitting, wrenching his body desperately in the smaller man\"s hold. Anyone walking past the alley that this show was going on in would have never guessed that the taller of the duo was bleeding heavily from a fresh gun wound. Anguish was rolling hard in Murphy\"s stomach. It hadn\"t happened, it just hadn\"t fucking happened. His vision was blurred by tears, and each time he tried to blink the salty build up away he was given a glimpse of house going up in a booming fireball. The house they\"d just recently vacated. The house that Connor had still been inside. Another wave of tearing grief rolled over him, drawing the pained cry from his lips. \"CONNOR!\" Romeo kept his grip as tight as he could, the man\"s blood already starting to coat his hands and making them slick, his leather gloves now trying to grip tighter as they slipped on Murphy\"s arm. He didn\"t speak, held his silence to allow the man to work out the torment that was raging through him. The truth was though, that the same misery was flooding through the Mexican\"s form. These two had become the best friends he had had, and now? Now one of them could be dead. The choked sound of Murphy\"s sobs, broken only by angry screams as he tried break free with the desperate need to race back to where his brother had last been seen breathing. The bellowing screams had started to break off into nothing more then heart wrenching sobs, body still twisting with a need to escape. \"Let me fuckin go Rome...I have ta go save him...\" \"No Murph.\" Romeo finally spoke, his voice low and oddly serious for the normally goofy third party. \"You can\"t go back there and we both fucking know it. If its bad, then Connor wouldn\"t want you to be caught by the cops over something you can\"t change. But we gotta think, we gotta think he\"s alright and just hiding up until the shit blows over and then he\"s gonna come looking for us spouting something about how we shoulda thought of just blowing the place the fuck up.\" His words were true and Murphy knew the words he said were true, but he couldn\"t wrap his heart around it. Knees turned to jelly, dropping the tall Irish man to his knees in the alley way. He was barely aware of the cold puddles soaking into the knees of his jeans. His cries no longer made any sound, just rattled his body as he rocked back and forth. But Romeo was sure his words had reached the grieving Irish man, so he released his tight hold and took a step back, giving him the room needed to mourn. And the separated twin took it, grasping his rosary tightly and turning a tear streaked face to the dark sky, howling out in the pain that rested deep in his heart. \"CONNOR!\" His head was pounding as he struggled back to the world of consciousness, for the moment forgetting where he was. The roaring pain in his head caused his stomach to roll, almost bringing a gag to his throat, allowing him to feel a strange weight there. The faint sound of shoes shuffling somewhere left him groaning and raising hands to grip at the sides of his head. This had to be the result of a bender. Again another dragging sound reached his ears, tearing through the tormenting headache. \"Murph, I swear ta Christ if ya don\"t stop dragging yer feet, I\"m goin\" lay ya out.\" He muttered in a low, groaning tone. \"I don\"t think you\"ll be getting that chance any time soon, Saint.\" The strange voice cut straight through the aching of his head, needling deep into a panic and snapping his eyes open. The house, Nicholas Yakavetta, the ambush, Murphy and Romeo and then the blow to the back of the head. His whole body lifted off the floor, eyes snapping open. The strange weight at his throat tugged again, this time almost choking him. \"Murph?\" He gasped out, struggle to find his way to his hands and knees, fingers scrapping up to try and yank the gathering pressure hugging his neck. The tips only met metal instead. A steel collar? Connor\"s heart rate increased, praying loudly in his own mind that he hadn\"t just woken up into what he thought he had. \"You\"re brother is not here, Il mio cane.\" The voice repeated in an accent and language that gave him away as being Italian. \"Io non sono vostro cane.\" He growled back, voice tense. He still couldn\"t see the one speaking to him and so instead took the chance to look over himself. His shirt and jacket were gone, even his boots had seemed to vanish along with his belt. A breath left him in relief though at the sight of his rosary still pattering against his bare chest. \"Where is my brother?\" The blow seemed to come from no where, crashing brutally into his side, the thick rubber sole of the boot catching him in the lower ribs. A grunt was forced from him and he moved just as swift. Lurching up to his feet, one fist swung out in the direction of where the leg had been. There was an instant where knuckles meet the flesh of another and he farther forward, pushing harder to get the man he knew was trying to back away. A dangerous smirk played on his lips as he pushed farther forward. For the moment, the steel that had encased his neck like a collar had been forgotten until the metal bit back, crushing painfully at his wind pipe and jerking him back with a wheezing, growling curse. Connor managed to scramble himself up into a crouched position, glancing behind him to see the heavy chain that was outfitted to the collar and embedded in a hoop embedded into the concrete wall. A leash? He was on a fucking leash? \"You dirty fuckin\" wops better let me off of ta this thing before I use the chain to choke every last one of yer greasy necks!\" He hollered, now nearly panting with the rage and panic at being chained up like some kind of beast. All the worst, he still didn\"t know what had become of Murphy or Romeo. All he could hope was they were somewhere blazing up the badies to get him the fuck out. This blow came harder, crashing down against the flat of his bare back, something sharp digging into the flesh and tearing. Small scratches formed along Jesus\"s face on his back, swelling with blood and giving the tattoo of their savior the impression of crying tears of crimson. The hit knocked the wind out of him, sending him to all fours with a sharp gasping intake of breath. \"One does not unleash their dog until they are certain the beast will not bite their own hand.\" His mystery guest continued to speak, almost serenely from the shadows, out of Connor\"s eye sight. Still, the lost twin looked around, noting for the first time that be seemed to be in same type of room that the first Yakavetta had trapped the trio in. The same room where the mob boss made the mistake of killing Rocco and leaving the brothers alive to avenge it. \"I don\"t get what yer talkin about.\" He snarled back, pushing up off his hands to kneel instead, shuffling back to seek out the wall to help to his feet. Even leashed, he was going to do all that he could to keep himself away from the image and a trained animal. \"And ya didn\"t answer my question. Where is my brother?\" The chuckling sound that reached his ears from the dark corners of the room was infuriating, rising Connor\"s blood quickly into a heated boil. Rage crashed against honest fear, knowing that he needed to know his brother was alive or he would raise hell in this room until either he, or the man in the dark were dead. If he had his way, it would be the first or both. \"Don\"t worry about your brother, cane. I saw that retarded spic dragging him off just before the boom. Where they are now, I haven\"t any idea. But they surely aren\"t here, and he is not coming to your aid.\" The voice mused, the humor in his tone enough to leave Connor snarling. \"See, even now you glower and act like a beast. You don\"t even stop to think, to ask. What should one of us want with a live Saint brother? Why risk the chance of you having a gun returned to your hand? I had the shot back in the house to have my man shoot you square in the back of the head before you would have even known he was there. After all, isn\"t a dead Saint better then anything?\" Connor was able to tell the man that remained hidden was pacing. His eyes drifted back in forth against the shadows, trying to follow the trail of the voice as it shifted from left to right, senses honed should he have the chance to attack. Relief had been stronger then he imagined at the knowledge that his brother and friend were still alive. Not just because it meant they\"d survived, but because it meant there was hope that he would get out of this tiny one man prison. The one thing he didn\"t want to admit was the curiosity over the truth behind the man\"s words. Why was he not dead? If a clear shot had been there, why had it not been taken? There wasn\"t a mobster or criminal that he knew of in South Boston that would have overlooked the chance to do in one of the Saints. Yet here he was, a prisoner of one of those exactly, not even tightly bound and beaten. Nothing but a steel collar and thick chained leash kept him from causing chaos in this small room. The question must have been marked clearly on his face because the voice chuckled in response. \"You see, Connor...\" The drifting of the voice stopped, showing that the man had paused to turn him, as though asking for a correction on the name. \"I assume you\"re shouting for Murphy would make you the other twin. So, you see, Connor...I know who your third was. The old man that made up the Trinity. A thing of legend still despite the old man\"s passing a while ago. He was a frightening man, your father. Such an artist, such a killer. My own people made to use him as their pawn, calling him in when they needed help, relying on his skills to dispatch all our enemies, not his. He was sometimes tricked into believing the men he went after were worse then they were, but still, I don\"t think it would have mattered to the old man. His job was to kill for us, and he did well. He did it happy. A natural born bastardo.\" \"My Da was a good fuckin man, ya keep yer fuckin mouth shut about him!\" The man paused in his story, almost as though he were surprised about Connor\"s reaction to his father being called a killer, a bastard. Maybe the Italian figured the boys knew and had dismissed the knowledge. But now it seemed they knew, and just didn\"t care. \"Really, this has nothing to do with your father Connor.\" He now continued talking once more, as though never interrupted. \"But everything to do with you. And possibly your brother if we can track him down and make the offer. I\"m sure once we tell him who we have here, he\"ll be eager to listen to our offers.\" The chain let out a fierce snapping sound as Connor\"s full body weight was suddenly thrown against the collar, not even seeming to notice the pain of the metal digging at his throat. There was rage in his eyes. A pure, unfiltered hate that was all consuming and promised death. \"Ya so much as look at my brother and I promise ya my last breath will not come until yer\"s has been stolen from yer chest.\" He hissed out, tone low. The idea of this strange man trying to find his way anywhere near Murphy set Connor instantly on edge. He was want to tear out at the man, yet still, knowing what he could about this rather unorthodox turn of events could prove to be quiet helpful in mounting an escape. Still he put on the show, hurling himself at the end of the leash like a rabid creature, roaring threats and venting frustrations until the pain of the digging collar forced him to stop, sagging to his knees as though defeated and hung his head low, chin resting against the top of his chest. \"Ya leave him out ta this...\" The sound of the shoes reached him again, shuffling closer. Connor sucked in a slow breath, holding it and reminding himself to remain still, keep his head down. The image had to be believable in order to draw the man closer. Only then could he get them to let their own guard down, come close enough to give him a chance. The boots came closer, just a little bit more. Three steps, one step, two steps. There! Connor moved swiftly, all motions a completely smooth. He spun, still crouched low and struck out with one leg, aiming for the back of the man\"s knees. There was a grunt of air that meant that his blow had hit. One arm streaked up, grabbing for a fist full of shit to yank the man down to his back, now at Connor\"s level as she swung a leg over the man\"s chest and circled his hands around her throat, applying the same chocking pressure that the steel collar had given him. \"Give me the key to this and ya\" may find yer\"self spared yet.\" He snarled out, eyes leaking nothing but pure menace, showing that he meant every tiny bit of his threat to do the man in right here even if it meant he had to rot at the end of this chain. The man he grasped was trembling, face turning red beneath Connor\"s tight grip. \"Very skilled, very smart. This is why I want you for my cane.\" The voice still came from the shadows, shattering Connor\"s resolve. The man, the Italian talking was still hiding. This man he was strangling was a decoy. And it worked perfectly, giving them the upper hand. The boot came crashing out of the darkness, cracking hard into the side of his head and sending him sprawling off the top of the man. He rolled a few feet, trying to blink away the daze but not being able to. The room tilted around him as his pain filled his skull enough to make his stomach roll. He got it, he finally got what was happening, what this man wanted. \"I will use my last breath ta make sure ya don\"t get it...\" He muttered out before he was pitched into the darkness once more, body going still on the cold cement of the floor. The form moved out of the shadows, the dim light falling across the facial features of one familiar. Nicholas Yakavetta smiled down at his new prize, his pitbull at the end of his chain. He knelt down, a hand coming up and out and reaching to stroke the unconscious Irish man\"s cheek in a tender move. \"Let the training begin...\" Il mio cane: \"My Dog\" Io non sono vostro cane: \"I am not your dog.\" -And there is chapter two! Please, click the button at the bottom of the page and let me know what you think!", "\"It was you...It wasn\"t a dream, was it? It actually happened\".Hades nodded. \"It did. I put your sister to sleep after that encounter and promised one day to return for her when most she needed me. Now is that time\".\"She prayed to you and this is how you repay her? By holding her hostage\"\"She is no hostage, princess. Far from it. She has as much freedom in my, or rather our, world as much as I do. She may not be queen quite yet, but she is still...close to me...\"\"You fell in love with her?\"\"From the very day I saw her. She is my opposite, my counter thesis, my...my other half in a sense. Her innocence was what brought me to her. Then it was how she treated me\". Andromeda listened to him with intrigue. He looked thoughtful, but sounded wounded as he spoke. The dark eyes glazed over in reflection and deep thought, as if he were gazing into his own heart, his own soul, and perhaps he was. \"She wasn\"t afraid. She cared for me...ever since the beginning. Her tenderness, her care...it touched me somewhere. Somewhere I hadn\"t before. I knew the thoughts were wrong, as she was only a child, but my fate was sealed. Eros had already shot me...and his arrow had gone deep\". She didn\"t know what to say. He continued, going on as if she wasn\"t even there. \"At first it was the thoughts. The memories, from the flowers to her eyes and her sweet treatment of me. It was that treatment that destroyed the wall around this heart...and tore it open. I resisted, I tried. I tried my hardest, but she was everywhere. I tried to rebuild it, to make my defenses stronger, but it was futile...She was everywhere to me. I showed mercy, mercy! Mercy toward souls who I knew full well didn\"t deserve it, all because I couldn\"t keep Persephone out of my head...\" he paused and then went on, \"Then came the thoughts, the hopes and the dreams. I dared to dream that she would grow to love me, that her care could turn into something special, something she and I could share\".\"You fell in love with her, and she was only a child\".\"I did. I tried so hard not to, but the harder I tried to resist, the more obvious it was and the harder I fell. I watched over her as she grew. I knew she was just as lost and alone as I was. I couldn\"t let her live a life of emptiness, not after what she\"d given me. So I brought her to my world. Things have been somewhat unstable between us, as she appears to have forgotten about the fields. But they\"re getting better\".\"So she\"s safe?\"Hades nodded. \"I\"d never let anything harm her\".\"You seem to genuinely care for my sister. Thank you for telling me about this. I take it you wish no one else to know?\"\"Not for the time being. When the time comes perhaps I shall reveal it myself. But according to the Fates, only you must know of my plans. Is that hers?\"\"Yes\" Andromeda handed the cloak to him, \"I didn\"t know if you\"d know it was me without it or not. Perhaps you could give it to her\".\"I will. Princess Andromeda I owe you my thanks. Your sister is a wonderful girl and I will cherish her from now until the end of time, know that\".\"Be good to her\".\"I shall. Until next we meet, I bid you farewell. And perhaps I may let Persephone return soon\". Before Andromeda could say anything else, Hades vanished into the shadows of the cave, the cloak clasped tightly in his hold. Chapter 7. Dark Side \"Everybody\"s got a dark side. Do you love me? Can you love mine? Nobody\"s picture perfect, but we\"re worth it. You know that we\"re worth it. Will you love me, even with my dark side?\"-Kelly Clarkson, \"Dark Side\" Much to his surprise, Hades found that Persephone wasn\"t in her room. A strange, yet warming sight greeted him at the Underworld\"s entrance. Persephone was petting Cerebrus affectionately and treating him with both intelligence and like a house pet. For a moment, envy stabbed him. He wanted to feel that touch, to hear that voice, and to see that sweet look turned toward him. Granted they\"d come to an understanding not too long ago, things were still shaky. She didn\"t trust him, not entirely. Hades had no wish to push things, but he wished with all his might that she would remember how she was toward him. A part of him understood why she didn\"t. Children normally didn\"t remember things like that. Not to mention he made it seem like a dream, so maybe she remembered it as such. Persephone stood at the sight of him. \"Sorry. He just looked lonely standing here waiting for you...I thought maybe he wanted to be petted for a bit\" she admitted.\"It\"s alright. It has indeed been a time since I paid him any attention. Sorry for my neglecting you my friend\" Hades reached for the middle head which was bent down to him and petted the muzzle gently.\"He\"s your friend?\"\"One of few that I have. He\"s possibly my closest. He\"s been here since my banishment\".\"You seem good to him\".\"Of course, he does as I require of him\".\"And that is?\"\"Keep souls from escaping. What about you? Did you have any furry companions in your world?\"\"Well...I used to take in wounded and orphaned animals when I was younger. In fact\" Persephone looked at Hades with soft eyes, \"I actually wanted to bring you home as a wolf\".\"Really?\"\"I\"ve always wanted a tame one, but I know I\"d never have the heart to cage one. A palace is a cage, no matter how big or luxurious it is\".\"I wouldn\"t mind. Just as long as you loved me\". Persephone\"s soft gaze turned to one of confusion and then intrigue. She knew already that he wanted her love, but even as an animal...well, she guessed it made sense. Just because he was in a different form didn\"t make him any different than as he was. Persephone went back to petting Cerebrus, but couldn\"t help but wonder: Would she have loved him as an animal? It certainly would\"ve been easier to, but just not in the way he wanted. But still, now she wondered if it was possible now... She was quiet now. Had he been too bold in his last statement? He was only trying to be honest with her. As he watched her pet Cerebrus\" middle head, he wondered if maybe it would\"ve been better to have stayed a wolf just for a little time. But then that would\"ve been a lie and Hades would\"ve rather died than lie to her. And that was saying a lot. He remembered her cloak. \"Oh, I met your sister at the cave. She told me to give you this\" he held it out to her. At the mention of her sister, Persephone turned and faced him. Hanging on his arm was her hooded cloak. Delighted she took it from him. \"Thank you. How is Andromeda?\"\"She\"s doing well. She misses you though. Your family has all of Argos looking for you. Soon I fear it shall be all of Greece\".\"Andromeda-\"\"She won\"t tell. Yes, she knows it was me\".\"And what does she think?\"\"She just wants you to be happy\". Persephone sighed and looked down. Yes, as if that was possible here in this dark kingdom. The sun never shined and there was nearly no light. No hope for escape either. Hades easily could tell she was unhappy, he didn\"t have to read her mind to know that. Maybe being here wasn\"t the best...Maybe he could try though still. He shifted to his wolf form and put his head under her hand, whining softly. The princess looked down at the red eyed wolf under her hand and gently stroked the ebony furred head. Although she knew the wolf was Hades, she couldn\"t help it. Persephone loved animals too much. She kneeled next to the wolf and ran her hand down his back as he let out a small growl of pleasure. Hades put his head against her, snuggling himself between her arms and chest in perfect contentment. He knew Zeus had seduced many mortal women this way, but he wasn\"t doing this to seduce the princess. Just to feel loved by her for a short time. He whined and put his head on her chest, growling softly to the sound of her heart. When she didn\"t move, when she kept her place petting him, he felt loved and he felt stronger. \"Why can\"t you be like this all the time?\" Persephone asked.I could if you wished.\"I couldn\"t ask you to do that\".I would gladly do it. For you, my dear I\"d do anything.\"Why?\"Because he moved his head a little ways away and licked her cheek I love you, Persephone She couldn\"t say she was surprised, because she wasn\"t. Every answer to her questions like that were always answered that way: Because he loved her. But why? What was so special about her? All her life she\"d seen Andromeda as better. But here and now a god, the oldest of gods, was a docile wolf snuggled to her chest and begging to be loved...by her of all people. For a moment she felt proud, honored even. But at the same time she was confused. I have always loved you Persephone. I\"ve watched you grow from the sweet child you were into the lovely woman you\"ve become now. Your heart is all that mine strives to be. To see just one smile, one look, one sweet word from you is my utmost ambition. I am in love, Persephone. Here I am, Hades shifted back to his god form, practically kneeling before her as if she were a goddess, \"Begging for your love and I\"ve never begged for anything in my life. I\"m not perfect, my princess, but for you I will try. For you I\"d do anything you wished. Be anything you wanted me to be\". Now she was surprised. He was looking up at her, his gray eyes slightly widened, moist a little. He really was begging, and he truly wanted it. In that moment, Hades wasn\"t the lord of the underworld. No, he was a man. Just a sad, lonely, lovesick man begging, yearning to be loved and by her of all people. The intensity of his confession was much to take in. He was begging to be loved, to be rid of the pain that plagued him his whole existence nearly and he was asking her to be the one to end it. Could she? Was it possible? The questions that came with his confession were too much for her to take in. Persephone moved away from him, backing into Cerebrus. He saw her expression, pale, wide eyed as if frightened. \"Persephone...please...\" She heard no more and ran off, back to the underworld\"s palace, trying to find any place to get away from him and to get a clear head... Chapter 8. \"I won\"t run away\" \"The trouble with truth is it never lies. And the trouble with wrong\"s that it\"s never right. So I rest my head under your light\".-Thousand Foot Krutch, \"Already home\" \"Why?\" he asked Hecate later on a short visit, \"Why would she run like that?\"\"I think\" she started, \"You frightened her\".\"How? Why would she be afraid? I wouldn\"t hurt her for the life of me\".\"You haven\"t given her a reason to trust you, to put her faith in you. She goes by what she hears, despite her prayers. You must find a way to break that illusion the stories of you have created for her\".\"I almost had her. She loves animals. I had her as a wolf...perhaps I was too straightforward with this\".\"That might\"ve been it. Or bad timing. She hasn\"t gotten over the initial shock of your trickery. These things take time, Lord Hades\".\"Time is a luxury she nor I may have\".\"I know you seek to overthrow your brother, but I\"m getting the idea that perhaps this is your top priority\".\"I love her. Tell me how I can show her\".\"First, give her space. You\"ve been hounding her since you brought her here. You need patience, my lord. She\"ll come to you when she\"s ready. For now, what she needs is her own personal space. I know you seek her companionship above all else, but the matters of the heart are not just a one way thing. There\"s quid pro quo and a lot of time that\"s put in it to make it work. If you love her like you claim you do, let her come to you on her own time\".\"And then what?\"\"Once she comes to you, that\"s up to you to figure out. Learn more about her. You know she loves animals, but what else do you know about her?\"\"She loves gardening. She loves all things that have beauty both inside and out...much like herself\".\"Ah\" Hecate smiled brightly, \"Then perhaps when the time comes, you should show her around your own gardens. You have after all kept all those flowers she\"s given you all these years. I\"m sure you can make them decent...or have someone do it. If you need help, I\"d be more than glad to do it\".\"You know, you\"ve just given me an idea. Perhaps I could give it to her. She loves flowers so much, why not give her the garden?\"\"Now you\"re speaking her language. That\"s an excellent start and even better opportunity for you and her to get to know one another. But for now, she needs space and time to think. It\"s an awkward situation for her, so do try to understand how she feels in all this\".\"I will try, but success isn\"t something I can guarantee\".\"It never is. Love generally isn\"t easy, especially for one such as yourself. But for now, as I say, wait\".\"And wait I shall...albeit impatiently\". Hecate smirked as Hades left her again. All things would come together in time... Persephone meanwhile was having difficulties of her own. She couldn\"t get Hades out of her mind. His pleading look, those eyes that reminded her of a lost puppy...A part of her pitied him but at the same time, she was infuriated. He\"d tricked her, depriving her of the safety and comfort of her home and for what? A bleak world where she knew she didn\"t belong in. But at the same time, who was she to deny a man, a god rather, of happiness that was within her power to give? She didn\"t know what he would do to her if she didn\"t at least try to reciprocate his feelings just a little. And whether she acknowledged it or not, a part of her wanted to return them. For the longest time, she feared she\"d grow old and die alone, but here in this strange new world, she had someone. Someone who would stand by her no matter what, someone who loved her. Hell, possibly needed her. Maybe, just maybe, he deserved a chance. And who knew, maybe she\"d find he was worthy of her after all. But right now, she didn\"t see herself worthy of him, as he wasn\"t just a god, but the eldest of them. Why would he take an interest in her? What was so special about her? Sitting up on her bed, Persephone pondered the possibilities. She remembered that dream, the one he claimed wasn\"t truly a dream. She\"d called him the shadow man back then, keeping her promise to keep who he was and their encounter a secret. But after a time, Persephone grew to believe that it was just as it was, a dream and nothing else. But as if it were instinct, she still prayed to the shadow god, hoping perhaps maybe she could prove herself wrong. Well, she did now and things weren\"t going to get easier for her if she stayed locked up all day doing nothing. If this was going to work, she needed to take the first step, as she knew he\"d already done enough... He was surprised to find her out of her room again just hours after his visit with Hecate. Had the witch goddess been right after all? Persephone looked solemn, apologetic almost. Hades wondered what she was thinking. \"Um...hi\".\"Is everything alright?\"\"Yes, everything\"s fine...I just figured it\"d be okay if...well...you know...we could talk perhaps?\"\"I\"m always here if you wish to talk. By all means, speak your mind\". Persephone took a seat next to him and looked down thoughtfully for a moment and then at him again. \"Let me start off by saying that I am deeply sorry about earlier. It\"s just that...that no one\"s ever told me things like that. It was a lot to take in\".\"I know, and I\"m sorry for that, Persephone. I know it was a lot to take in, but it\"s what you do to me. You make me think and feel differently\".\"I don\"t want us to be on bad terms because I know what you want. But it\"s not gonna be easy for me to give\".\"I know that now, and I don\"t expect it right away. But perhaps with some time...who knows?\"\"Yeah...Just right now though, it feels somewhat awkward\".\"Somewhat?\"\"Alright, very. But...I guess a part of me is just wanting to know you better. I just wish that maybe we could come to some kind of understanding\".\"Thank you, Persephone. For at least this, coming to me with this idea of yours\".\"Of course. I mean, I\"m gonna be here a while, I might as well\".\"I want you to be comfortable here, princess. I care about you immensely. So if there\"s anything, anything at all you may want, bring it to me and I will do whatever I can to acquire it\".\"Alright. Thank you\".Hades took her hand, holding it gently. \"No, thank you\". Chapter 9. Broken \"Cause I\"m broken, when I\"m open and I don\"t feel like I am strong enough. \"Cause I\"m broken when you\"re gone away\".-Seether, \"Broken\" The first night of their understanding was a little awkward, as neither of them knew what to say. Hades had gotten Persephone more food from the upper world, keeping up his belief that she was indeed not ready to spend her life in his world. In the end, the choice would inevitably be hers. But tonight she didn\"t seem hungry, just picking at her food and looking down at the floor. \"Does something trouble you?\" he finally asked.\"Oh, no, not at all. It\"s just the silence. I hate being the one to break it\" Persephone gave a little nervous laugh.\"You and I both. Well then, we\"ll just have to keep speaking won\"t we?\"The princess smiled. \"Of course\".\"Any topics in mind?\"\"Is it hard? Ruling a world like this?\"\"It can be overwhelming, yes and difficult at times\".\"How do you base where someone goes?\"\"I base it on how they lived in life. See, I know all mortals, thanks to Thanatos\".\"You mean...death itself?\"\"Himself, my dear. Yes. Death is male. Yes, that\"s a common misplacement. I am not the god of death; I am merely the ruler of the dead. I do however have some power to give and take life. Not as much as Thanatos does, mind you, but just enough\".\"Interesting. Have you ever given life?\"\"I did once...with the Kraken. I\"m sure you know that story\".\"Of course. Everyone does. And have you ever taken it?\"\"Taken it? Not in recent centuries, no. I haven\"t had a need to, since you mortals do that well enough on your own\".\"Sometimes I hate being human\".\"And why\"s that?\"\"I\"m sure you already know. But we\"re so...hateful. All we ever seem to do is hate each other. And then when something goes wrong we turn it on you gods, blaming you for it. It\"s not right\".\"You\"re not like that\".\"In my innermost nature I am\".Hades shook his head. \"You\"re the furthest thing from it, Persephone. I would know. Zeus created you with among the purest of souls. While yes, every mortal has a dark side, you included, yours isn\"t as dominant as others. You wouldn\"t hurt anyone. You\"re too gentle; it\"s against your very nature\".\"How do you know that? That Zeus made me that way, I mean\".\"Because I was there. All the gods were, my dear. We all partake in some form or other every mortal\"s creation\".\"What part did you have in mine?\"Hades smirked knowingly. \"Me and my brothers help to create the souls of mortals. Each of us give mortals different personality traits which is up to them to use. It was I who gave you your innermost nature, the darker side. I couldn\"t give you a lot of darkness because I could feel your light even before you were fully formed. But then my brother took you and I didn\"t think I\"d ever see or feel your light again\". Safe to say, Persephone was touched. It was because of him she had her good heart and kind nature. Had he always loved her? Even before she existed? It was all different, confusing somewhat. Seeing her slight confusion, Hades was more than glad to put it in simple terms. \"It\"s just as I\"ve told you, Persephone. I\"ve loved you since the very beginning\".\"You...you planned this? All of it?\"\"No! No, not all of it. I just wanted...\" he didn\"t know how to explain it. What had he wanted? What had gone through his head when he first felt and saw her light, before she was ever even a thought to her family? He\"d wanted that light for himself. Why should the mortals have had it when he lived in the darkness alone? But he knew he couldn\"t hold it forever, and he didn\"t want the light to ever fade. Still more, he had to abide by the laws of nature itself. He still had to make it a mortal soul and that included giving the soul a darkness in it. So to fix that problem, he gave the soul some, but not as much as he would any other. He found it odd later that Zeus never objected to it. \"What? What was it you wanted? Face it Hades, you manipulated me even before I was born!\"\"I...Persephone I\"m sorry. If there was a way I could change that, I would\".\"I\"m a weakling...I have no strength because of you! Because my nature is just...it\"s too light...\".\"A weakling? Never! Many things you may be, Persephone, but weak is by no means one of them. I just didn\"t want your light to fade. I didn\"t want you to be corrupted by other people. But yes, I had wanted your light for myself, but I see now it\"s not mine to keep. That\"s why I don\"t have you eat the food of my world\".\"You don\"t want me to stay?\" she looked upset then.\"No, I never said that. Oh no...what I mean is that your light isn\"t mine to keep. I\"ve known that since the beginning. I love you Persephone, I\"d do anything within limits to get you to stay, but never, ever, would I be so selfish as to keep you away from those you love. Which is why the choice is ultimately yours. I want you to be happy, but I don\"t believe myself completely unworthy of happiness. So even if you choose to leave, I will be perfectly happy knowing I had you for some little time\"."]}

A/N: Next is Mekt, then Legion of SuperVillains, and then I\"ll tackle all the minor characters, like Alexis, Zyx, Drax, the President, etc.", "and then he ran off. So I told Raimundo, yeah, the Brazilian guy, that Jack had come in, and he seemed kind of mad, and then I fell off the tree.\" Kimiko said, chatting with Keiko again. \"WHAT?!?! AREYOUALLRIGHTDIDYOUCRACKYOURHEADAREYOUCALLINGFROMTHEHOSPITALAAUGH!!!\" \"I\"m fine. Rai used his \"Dragon of the Wind\" powers to fly and save me. It was like one of those stupid princess movies you like.\" Kimiko rolled her eyes as her friend calmed down. \"They\"re not stupid...and how romantic! I can\"t believe he hasn\"t asked you out yet!\" Keiko exclaimed. \"Have you already forgotten? No guys for a while until I have a chance to beat the fool up?\" \"Oh yeah...but still...he\"s perfect for you!\" \"We\"ll see about that. I\"ll talk to you later, Keiko.\" Kimiko hung up and logged in to her email. Two new messages popped up: one from her ex(which she ignored), and one from someone named... \"Spack? Who\"s Spack?\" Kimiko clicked on the message and read it... A/N: Ah, yes. The smell of canon is in the air. Next chappie coming soon! I 3 reviews! \"Dear Kimiko, Meet me at the cherry trees tonight. Love, Spack\" \"Who\"s Spack?\" Kimiko frowned, deep in thought. \"Only one way to find out...\" Kimiko grabbed an overcoat and slipped out of the temple unnoticed. She ran swiftly through the trees, seaching for any sign of life. Unknowingly, she bumped into someone and they tumbled to the ground. Their breathing suddenly quickened as Kimiko squinted through the darkness to see who it was... \"Jack? Why do you keep \"visiting\"?! If you\"re trying to get Wu, go try and get it so I can beat you to a pulp!\" Kimiko stood up and dusted herself off, glaring condencendingly upon Jack\"s sissy face. Jack stood up shakily and ran a hand through his hair. \"But..I\"m Spack.\" Kimiko scowled and smacked Jack upside the face. \"Stop stalking me, you freak.\" Kimiko sauntered away from Jack and his pitifulness. The next day, Master Fung gave the monks the whole day off. Raimundo continued to teach Clay and Omi to play soccer, and Kimiko sat outside playing (it just arrived in the mail the hour before) Goo Zombies 15 and watching the boys at their sport. Kimiko had just finished level 8 when an email popped up. \"Sorry. Spack\" Kimiko scowled and deleted the message, before closing her laptop and joining the boys. \"Hey, guys. I\"m in. Me and Rai versus you two.\" \"Fair enough! I will punch your heads!\" Omi shouted, grabbing the ball and throwing it down on center field. (Punch your headskick your butts). The small round-headed orphan called out to his power. \"Wudai Neptune Water!\" A giant wave came and crashed down on the makeshift field and the other three monks fought to stay afloat in the fake tsunami. Kimiko rose above the water and summoned her element. \"Wudai Mars Fire!\" The ensuming blaze evaporated the water and threw the ball to the other side. Raimundo flipped after the ball, sticking his foot out and slamming the ball into the other team\"s goal. \"Whoo! First score!\" Rai grabbed Kimiko around the waist and swung her around in glee. Her face colored and Rai placed Kimiko back down on the ground. Omi pouted and reset the ball. Clay and Rai faced off. Clay got in first kick, using his element to send in right next to the goal. \"Wudai Crater Earth!\" Omi jumped into a follow-up with his \"Repel the Monkey\" move. The ball missed by a inch, and bounced back to mid-court. Raimundo dribbled the ball to 3/4 field and passed it to Kimiko, who missed it. Clay caught the ball and dribbled it toward the other side, unaware that Rai was about to ambush him. \"Wudai Star Wind!\" A whirling North Wind hit Clay and the ball head-on and whisked them away to the goal. Kimiko tipped the ball just a bit, and the ball had officially scored. \"Yes! Two to nothing! Still gonna \"punch our heads\", Omi?\" Kimiko taunted, laughing through their obvious victory. Omi stared up and Kimiko in a small rage. \"YESIWILLISHALLHAVEVICTORYVICTORYISMINENOONECANDEFEATME!!!!\" Omi flew into a fury of victory demands. \"Guys, y\"all are obviously gonna win, so how \"bout we forfeit and we can all relax, pard\"ner?\" Clay offered, tipping his hat. \"Sure, why not. You guys were gonna lose anyhow.\" Raimundo shrugged and sat back against a tree. Omi sat down right where he was and pouted. Clay grabbed a rope and started practicing his lassoing. Kimiko booted up her laptop and resumed her game of Goo Zombies 15. \"I have got to stop being so stupid! If she\"s ever going to like me, I have to show her I\"m better than Raimundo!\" Jack glared at his soccer-loving rival as he hovered in the trees where he\"d been spying on the dragons. Kimiko sat alone in her room, as she did every evening. She booted up her PlayPod(Seventh Generation) and loaded Goo Zombies 15. \"Load game, single player, level twenty-seven...start game.\" Kimiko\"s eyes glazed over as she immersed herself in the game, mumbling out commands as she selected them. A second player joined the game and started obliterating zombies left and right. \"Wow, you\"re good...\" Kimiko paused the game to see who second player was: Raimundo. \"I used to play it back in Brazil, when they first started selling Goo Zombies down there.\" The two finally got to the boss level and started to slash at the giant goo-covered zombie dinosaur. About three minutes later, goo-dino was down for good. \"What\"s it like, in Brazil?\" Kimiko questioned. \"It\"s...home, you know? Like when you back to visit Japan, you always feel at home, no matter where you are.\" Raimundo ran a hand through his hair. \"We-my family and I-lived in the better part of Rio de Janeiro, but it was still kind of...ghetto.\" \"What\"s your family like?\" \"They\"re different, my sisters were always very bossy and had a temper(kind of like you, Kimiko), and two of my three brothers were very shy. My third brother was very tough and really...a big jock. But we were all still family...I can\"t believe I haven\"t talked to them since Chinese New Year.\" Raimundo looked mildly downcast as he reminisced about his family. Kimiko put a hand on his shoulder. \"I\"m sorry I was prying..it\"s just, I wanted to know more about you. I mean, we\"ve been training together for nearly four years and I still know almost nothing about you.\" Kimiko looked up into Raimundo\"s eyes, wondering what really went through his head. Rai broke their gaze and restarted the game, beginning level twenty-nine. They talked and laughed their way to level forty-six, when Raimundo finally glanced at the clock. \"OMG it\"s already midnight! I\"d better go...Master Fung is going to kill us when he sees how tired we are in the morning. Bye, Kim.\" Raimundo winked and began to stride out of Kimiko\"s room. \"Wait.\" Kimiko stood up and caught Raimundo, who turned around and gave her a quizzical face. Kimiko pulled his arms around her and leaned on his chest, her ears ringing with the sound of his heartbeat. \"Thanks...I don\"t usually get much one-on-one time with any of my friends out here in China...\" Raimundo studied the small girl that had enfolded herself in his embrace...he liked it. Kimiko stared up at Raimundo and kissed him sweetly, thanking him for their time together. Raimundo was surprised, but didn\"t break the kiss, enjoying her lips against his. Kimiko smiled and let go of Raimundo, who stumbled out of the room, holding the kiss next to his heart. A/N: Fluff! A chappie full of FLUFF! I luff FLUFF!...this chapter really had no point...except to have more FLUFF!(And make poor Jack madder.) FLUFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!(Marshmallows, anyone? They\"re free...why, you ask? Because they\"re FLUFFY!!!!!!!!!!!!)(I\"ll stop with the FLUFF!!!!!! outbursts now...FLUFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) A/N: Jack is so very SNEAKY! BWAHAHAHA!! Kimiko yawned and woke up, her eyes still closed. She stretched, hit something with her hand. That didn\"t faze her until the thing she hit said... \"Ow.\" \"AAUGH!!\" Kimiko screamed in horror as she realized that someone was in her bedroom. \"What the-? ...\" Jack stared wistfully at Kimiko\"s contemptuous figure. \"Sorry to scare you, but...uh...will you go out with me?\" \"WHAAAAT?! Nonononono, Jack! Absolutely not!\" \"B-But...\" \"GET OUT OF MY ROOM BEFORE I KILL YOU!!\" Jack slunk out of the room, and bumped into Omi. \"Why, hello, Jack Spicer. What are you doing here so early?\" \"Being rejected.\" \"Oh, well have fun with being rejected!\" Omi smiled and went about his way. Jack continued slumping down to the temple entrance(and for some reason, no one challenged him...) Kimiko strode out of her room in a new outfit she\"d just had shipped over from Japan. It consisted of a pink, sleeveless, knee-length dress and navy blue short leggings. Kimiko\"s hair had been dyed pink, and she wore a headband just behind her bangs. She strolled down the hall feeling abnormally cheerful, humming a certain theme song to herself as she walked. Kimiko met Raimundo at the entrance to the breakfast room. \"Good morning, Raimundo!\" Kimiko flashed a huge smile at the boy, who bounced a smile just as big back. \"Good morning, Kimiko. Did you sleep well?\" Kimiko nodded and squeezed Rai\"s hand before entering the breakfast nook. \"Morning, everyone!\" Kimiko greeted Clay, Omi, and Dojo. \"Mornin\"...\" Clay, Omi, and Dojo replied sleepily. Clay continued to fry bacon, Omi continued to squeeze oranges, and Dojo continued to laze around. Kimiko grabbed a loaf of bread and began to toast the slices quickly. Raimundo whooshed the toasted bread onto a large serving plate and set it on the table. Clay finished up the last of the bacon and began on the eggs. Omi poured the last of the orange juice into the pitcher and started slicing oranges to eat. Soon, breakfast was ready and the monks could dig in. Their usual idle table chatter was interrupted when the vault alarm went off. Kimiko narrowed her eyes. \"Spicer.\" The four dragons ran out to the temple vault just in time to see Jack fly away on his helibot with two Shen-Gong-Wu. They sprinted after Jack, but it was too late. Jack had already gotten away. The kids returned to their meal in discontent, upset that Jack had gotten away so quickly. They finished their meal and cleaned up their dishes swiftly, no longer in the mood for chitchat. After finishing up their chores, everyone retreated to their respective rooms. \"She said no...I bet she\"s already hooked up with that soccer-loving freak!\" Jack slammed a hand down on the metal wall of his basement laboratory. He turned away, disgusted at himself and at Raimundo. \"Very well then...if she won\"t say yes now, she\"ll say yes after this!\" Jack attached the Shen-Gong-Wu to his wrist and called upon it. \"Guys! Come OUT!!\" Kimiko dashed screaming through the halls. \"Meet me in the vault!!\" Everyone gathered in the underground vault, curious as to what Kimiko had planned. \"This is important, so listen up. What Shen-Gong-Wu did Jack take?\" Dojo thought for a moment. \"He took two, the...OHCRAP.\" Kimiko nodded and glared at the boys, who still seemed unworried. \"Exactly. Do you understand what this means? Jack now has the power to take over the world!\" A/N: So which two Wu did Jack take? BWAHAHA! You\"ll have to wait until the next chappie to find out(unless you can figure it out already, smartypants...) This chappie was mostly filler so I could get to the meat of the story! And trust me, the meat is WAY better than the bread... Okay, random bit of history here: This is actually my first XS story, but rewritten, edited, and I changed the pairings and increased the depth of the story. Originally, it was going to be ClayKim, and Rai was the third wheel trying to be second wheel. But then I finished watching the show on YouTube and understood the canon of RaiKim(middle of Season Two and end of Season Three) and the jealousy of Jack(Episode Six, I remember which episode)...and voila! Insta-fanfiction! It\"s like Shanequa said...\"CANON! Apply directly to the fanfiction? Apply directly o the fanfiction! CANON!\" A/N: Now for the good stuff! Bwahaha!! (Aargh...reading way too much Avatar fanfics, especially Zutara ones...must...write...Xiaolin Showdown!) Kimiko watched as Raimundo and Clay hauled steel bars to cover the doors and windows. \"I can\"t believe I let this happen! This is all my fault!\" \"What do you mean by that, Kimiko? How\"s it your fault? You didn\"t do anything...\" \"That\"s just it!\" Kimiko snapped and leaped up to confront Raimundo. \"Jack kept visiting me for the past few days, and two days ago he asked me out.\" \"He did WHAT?! I swear, I\"ll kill him!\" Raimundo stormed. \"No...I\"m going to go resolve this. I bet if I date him, he\"ll give us the Wu back. I didn\"t do anything before, but now, it\"s time to take action.\" \"No! Kimiko, I won\"t let you! We can fight him! We\"ve beat the Sapphire Dragon before, we can do it again!\" \"Fine, Raimundo. But if we start to lose, I\"m just going to date him.\" \"But, Kimiko...\" Raimundo hissed into her ear. \"What about us?\" \"Rai...I will always be yours, but if all comes to worse, at least you\"ll be alive if I date him!\" \"Kim...I dont want to lose you, no matter what! I-I\"d die for you. That\"s how much I love you.\" Raimundo leaned down and claimed Kimiko\"s lips sweetly. Kimiko allowed him to, but pulled back when he tried to deepen the kiss. Clay and Omi watched, clueless. \"What happened between them?\" They though simultaneously. Clay and Omi exchanged a look. \"Um...we\"ll just be...going now, pard\"ners. We have some..uh...\" \"Laundry to finish!\" Omi dragged the dumbfounded Clay away from the couple. \"Kimiko, I will fight for you, even against impossible odds.\" Rai gazed into Kimiko\"s eyes. She stared back, glaring at him roughly. \"I will not let you die for nothing. And this is DEFINENTELY nothing.\" \"But...\" \"You are not dying for me and that\"s final. Got it?\" Raimundo nodded in defeat and walked away from Kimiko to finish their prep for Jack\"s onslaught. He attacked that night. A large blue dragon was spotted by the monks who patrolled at night. They immediately warned Master Fung. He knew his Dragons were prepared...but would they be able to win against a Jack scorned(the likes of which Hannibal Roy Bean has no fury...that was confusing). \"Whaddya think of me now, Kimiko? Still think I\"m inferior to Raimundo?!\" Jack flew on his helibot through the temple, destroying and sapphirizing everything and everyone in sight. \"Emperor Scorpion! Sapphire Dragon, I command you to freeze everyone except for me and Kimiko!\" The Dragon nodded and immediately stormed the temple. A sapphire scream rang through the temple. Kimiko snapped her head up and fine-tuned her hearing. \"Who was that?!\" Raimundo shrugged and joined Kimiko in running to the scene of the scream. Clay and Omi were already there and trying to fight off the Dragon. \"Who got zapped?\" Clay pointed hastily before dodging another zap from the Dragon\"s mouth. A dark blue version of Dojo lay on the floor, motionless. \"Dojo...\" And at that moment, Kimiko knew all hope was lost. A/N: Oh yeah! Jack is dominating(for now...)! What\"s gonna happen next?! Keep reading to find out! A/N: AARGH! Stupid aniki! He, Mini-man, and Kiba are going to pay! GRR! Who are aniki, Mini-man, and Kiba? Just a few...\"friends\"...who are about to get the biggest fussing of their lives. Hmmph. Kimiko grabbed whatever Shen-Gong-Wu she had in her back pocket. Jack raised an eyebrow and yelled at the Dragon. \"Hey, Sapphire Dragon! I command you to freeze the cowboy and he cheeseball over there!\" The Dragon turned toward Clay and Omi and shot a blast at them. Only one monk made it away unscathed. \"Clay!!\" Omi cried out in anguish as the Dragon of Earth\"s skin became blue and hard...a Sapphire end. Raimundo flipped toward the Dragon using the Mantis Flip Coin, holding a small torch. He waved the flames at the Dragon, but the Dragon ignored the tiny blaze and aimed a shot at Rai. He dodged it smoothly, only to see it bear down on Omi. \"Jack, stop! You don\"t have to do this!\" Kimiko ran up to Jack\"s hovering form with tears in her eyes. \"Please...stop this madness!\" Jack brushed her off and gestured at the Dragon. The Dragon immediately reacted and shot a blast at Raimundo. Raimundo never saw it coming. -ZAPOOSHOOM- \"RAI!!\" Kimiko ran over to her slowly sapphirizing boyfriend\"s limp body. \"NONONO, RAI!! STAY ALIVE, PLEASE!!\" Rai smiled weakly, as his face was engulfed by the dark blue crystal. \"I love y-\" Raimundo\"s lips froze in place as the sapphire tomb completed it\"s duty. Kimikocradled Raimndo\"s head sobbing. \"Rai...\" Kimiko looked over his shining face with lost hope. She bent down for one last kiss. A slight warmth graced his lips as she kissed him, but all too soon, it was gone. Kimiko leaned back, wiping tears from her eyes. \"Jack, you are so dead. HAPPY HEART!\" Kimiko braced herself for the incredibly annoying Good Jack to show up and fix everything. \"Reversing Mirror.\" Jack activated the one Shen-Gong-Wu he actually owned and deflected the insanely joyful ray lazily. \"Come on, Kimiko. Can\"t you see I\"m so much better than him? You didn\"t really like him did you?\" Kimiko stared up at Jack with a dull hatred in her eyes. \"No.\" Kimiko pulled Raimundo\"s Blade of the Nebula from the sheath that had fallen next to him. \"I loved him.\" With those final words, Kimiko stabbed herself, leaving a burning temple, a couple dozen sapphire statues, and a broken-hearted boy genius alone in the world. A/N: Okay, okay. I know, it was short, but I have other things to do besides write fanfiction all day(like maim those three Stooges I mentioned earlier). And if enough people say please, I\"ll write an epilogue. A/N: People said please. \"Nuff said. three years later... \"Jack, I\"m tired of being your menial slave. Free me...or at least deactivate me! I can\"t take it anymore!!\" The Sapphire Dragon breathed blue smoke into its master\"s face. Jack waved the Shen-Gong-Wu away, already regretting the voice box he\"d built for it. The Dragon slunk away and Jack sighed. \"Finally, peace and quiet.\" \"Or at least it would be if you could keep me out of your head. Sadly, I\"m way too strong for that. Sucks for you, Spacky.\" Jack dropped to the ground and clutched his head in pain. \"Get outta my head!!\" \"Oh no, Spacky. I won\"t be leaving so soon. You did kill me after all.\" \"No...NO! You killed yourself!\" \"Hmm...no matter. The point is I\"m dead. Because you just couldn\"t resist a pretty face.\" \"You were so pretty, Kimiko...\" A single tear slid down Jack\"s weary face. \"I guess I was. It must have been a good three years. Finally ruling the world...all because of me. I guess my death was great thing for you, wasn\"t it Spacky?\" \"No, Kim! You...Your death was the worst thing that could have happened to me! How could you love that Brazilian freak?! Why...I\"m a genius! I\"m bad! I\"m emo! I have cool goggles! I have robots! I\"m so much better than him!\" \"I guess so...you DO rule the world...I bet if you weren\"t so evil, I\"d still be alive.\" A stupid idea popped into Jack\"s head. \"So I bet if I stop being evil, you\"ll come back to life.\" \"Maybe, Spacky. Just maybe.\" Jack ran to his enslaved dragon and commanded it to jump into a volcano. The Dragon sighed in relief and obeyed, grateful to be freed from the servitude Jack always demanded. It immediately deactivated itself in the fiery pit. Jack turned to the thousands of people in his palace and they all looked back, confused that their former master was now just a depressed kid. One boy in particular ran up to Jack and puched him in the jaw. \"Where\"s Kimiko?\" Jack looked down sadly. \"Six feet under.\" \"You...you...YOU KILLED HER?!\" The boy smacked Jack across the face. \"What did you do to her?! I thought you loved her, Jack Spicer!\" \"I did...I didn\"t kill her. After I froze you, she panicked and killed herself with your Sword of the Nebula.\" Jack wiped his eyes off and beckoned to Raimundo. \"Her...her grave is over here.\" Jack showed Raimundo to a large statue that resembled Kimiko. At the base of the pedestal, a plaque was engraved with a short, passionate poem. \"You were right, I was wrong, He was away from you, Now you\"re gone. For Kimiko\" Raimundo traced the words on the plaque with his middle finger, slowly fading back into the time when he and Kimiko had been together. He turned to Jack, tearful and regretful. \"I should kill you. I should kill you right now.\" \"If it brings her back to life...I could care less whether I live or die. Not if she\"s dead.\" Raimundo grabbed Jack by the collar and grabbed his Sword of the Nebula from the sheath on his belt. He held the weapon up to Jack\"s skinny white neck. \"I really should kill you...but I won\"t.\" Raimundo dropped Jack on the groud. \"You are pathetic. I wouldn\"t even spit in your direction.\" A glare full of hatred an indignation, identical to Kimiko\"s, covered Raimundo\"s face. Jack\"s eyes bugged out. \"Give me that sword.\" Raimundo raised an eyebrow in surprise. \"No. I\"m not letting you commit suicide. I want you to live with what you\"ve done for the rest of your life.\" Raimundo scoffed at the fallen former ruler of the world. \"She\"s not coming back, and it\"s your fault, Spicer. I hope you live your life in eternal suffering. And so did Jack live the rest of his life, seething and loathing his supposed intelligence. A/N: Whee. I love writing angst. And I love writing insane people, too. So this last chappie was fun. Thanks for reading people!! Hope you enjoyed. Now I\"m gonna finish my Naruto story so I can publish it in the correct manner."]}

Trivette called Ranger Headquarters and ended up talking to Sydney. \"Ranger Cooke\" Sydney spoke into the phone. \"Syd, its Trivette. I need...\" Trivette was cut off in the middle of his sentence. \"Trivette, where are you. No one\"s been able to reach you or Alex. We\"re all worried about you two\" Sydney told him. \"I\"m fine and Alex will be. Hey has Walker come in yet or called at least?\" Trivette asked her. \"No and what\"s wrong with Alex?\" Sydney asked suddenly worried about her friend. \"She had a little scare last night with the baby. She\"s okay now; they put her on bed rest until the baby is born. She\"ll be better once Walker gets here. Can you try and find him? I promised Alex I wouldn\"t leave her until Walker got here\" Trivette explained to her. \"Sure. Anything else I can do to help, just let me know\" \"Okay. And just so you know, I already have people trying to reach Walker\" Trivette started to speak softer realizing Alex was listening and not wanting to scare her \"but so far they haven\"t been able to. I think that something happened to him\" \"Like what?\" Sydney questioned him. \"I don\"t know. Call it Cherokee, but something\"s not right here\" \"Okay I\"ll look into it. I\"ll get Gage to help me\" \"Thanks Syd. I\"ll call back later\" And with that Trivette hung up the phone. \"Has anyone heard anything from Walker?\" Alex asked when Trivette hung up the phone. \"Not yet, but he\"s due back any second\" Trivette thought, trying to reassure Alex that everything was fine. Meanwhile, Walker was facing problems of his own. One of the drug dealers had recognized him and he was now being help hostage while they figured out what to do with him. Walker knew he was due back today and knowing his he hoped that someone would come for him...before it was too late. Just then one of the drug dealers walked in. \"Well, well, well. Smith was telling the truth. If it isn\"t the famous Ranger Cordell Walker.\" Walker studied the guy over. He recognized him as Stevens, a guy he had arrested a few years back. \"What to do with you. That is the question\" Stevens thought out loud. \"While until we come up with something good, we\"ll just have to drug you\" Stevens took out a needle and stuck it in Walker\"s arm. \"Let\"s see if you are still willing to fight after that\" Stevens kicked him and left Walker alone in the cold, wet, dark cell he had been living in for the past few days. Walker\"s mind was full of thoughts of Alex. Would he live to see their baby born? Or to tell Alex just once more that he loved her? And finally the drug kicked in, causing Walker to travel to a different world. Sydney looked up when Gage came in. She grabbed him by the arm and pulled him out of the office. \"Hey. What\"s the big idea?\" Gage asked, not knowing what had gotten into Sydney. \"We have to find Walker. Now\" Sydney told him. \"He\"ll be back in a few hours\" \"No. Something\"s wrong. No one can reach him and it\"s not like him to be away for longer then he has to. Especially now that Alex is pregnant. He would have called if he were going to be late\" \"Maybe he couldn\"t\" \"We still have to find out what happened to him. I promised Trivette I would. Alex wants him\" Sydney then went on to explain to him what Trivette had told her when he called. They were soon at work trying to locate Walker. A few hours had pasted and still no Walker. Alex was now becoming really worried about Walker. So once again she asked Trivette what was going on. \"Jimmy, where\"s Walker? I want him and I want to go home\" Alex told him. \"You can\"t go home yet. The doctors want to make sure you are okay and you won\"t have another scare before sending you home\" \"You didn\"t answer my question. Where\"s Walker?\" Trivette sat silent trying to figure out if he should tell Alex the full-truth or half-truth. He didn\"t want Alex to worry, but what was he going to tell her. \"Jimmy, is Walker hurt\" Still Jimmy said nothing. He was still collecting his thoughts. \"Is he?\" Nothing still. \"Jimmy is Walker hurt or do you just not know where he is?\" Alex questioned him, hoping he would tell her what was going on. But when Trivette still said nothing, Alex had no choice but to threaten him with something. \"Jimmy, either you tell me what is going on or I\"ll call around and find out what\"s going on. I don\"t care how long it takes me. I want to know where my husband is. Now\" Trivette finally found his voice. \"I don\"t know how to tell you this Alex\" \"Then just say it. Please Jimmy\" Alex pleaded with him. \"Alex, no one knows where Walker is. We haven\"t been able to reach him\" Alex was at a lost of words. \"Alex, are you okay?\" Trivette asked. \"I will be or at least I will be eventually. I just don\"t know what\"s wrong with the world. After everything that happened yesterday and now no one knows where my husband it. Jimmy, promise me you\"ll find him. Please. I need Walker to be here with me for the rest of this pregnancy. I can\"t do it without him\" Alex said as she started to cry. \"Don\"t worry Alex. We\"ll find him. I promise\" Trivette told her as he gave her a hug. Lucky for Walker all Stevens knew about drugs was dealing them, but whatever drug he gave Walker hadn\"t lasted to long. Walker sat up. He started having a weird feeling that he hadn\"t had in a long time. It was the feeling that Alex needed him. And Walker was determined to get to her. He wasn\"t sure why Alex needed him, but he was sure that she did. Just then Stevens came back into Walker\"s \"cell\" He was alone so Walker used this as his chance to get out of that place and make his way made to Alex. Stevens approached Walker with another needle in his hands, but this time Walker was ready. He kicked the needle out of Stevens hand before proceeding to knocking him out. Walker picked up Stevens gun and very slowly and quietly made his way out into the hall. The hall was deserted. Walker was glad. It seemed that the other rangers were still going to be able to make the bust. Walker headed out the front door a few minutes later. He grabbed the keys to one of the cars parked in the front yard and then hopped in and started back towards Dallas, hoping not to run into anyone on his way back. Walker was right in thinking that the other rangers were going to continue on with the bust. Sydney and Gage, not having a clue as to where to go (all the leads they had gotten had come up empty) and were hoping that the bust would be the key to finding out if Walker was in trouble or just hadn\"t been able to contact them. But after the bust, Sydney and Gage quickly lost hope that Walker wasn\"t in any trouble. They couldn\"t find Walker in the bunch of guys. So once again they headed back to Ranger Headquarters. This time to try and get the guys to talk. Two hours later at Ranger Headquarters... \"Anything?\" Sydney asked as she saw Gage walk back in the office. \"Nothing. They all say they have no idea what we\"re talking about\" Gage told her. \"Gage what are we going to do? We have to find Walker. What are we going to do? We have nothing to go on\" \"I guess we have to wait and hope for a lead. So we get to play the \"waiting game once again\"\" Gage told her. Walker was halfway to Dallas when he ran out of gas. There wasn\"t a town within miles and Walker had no choice but to walk and hope he came upon a house or at least a pay phone. And so Walker sat off with one thought in his mind; to get back to Dallas. Walker thought of how lucky he was that Stevens hadn\"t given him to much of that drug and hadn\"t beaten him up to bad. True some parts of his body still hurt pretty bad and the thought of lying down and going to sleep was overpowering. In fact if he wasn\"t so determined to get back to Alex, Walker was sure he would have. He was sure that by now everyone knew he was missing; it was just a matter of how long it took for them to head out to Stevens\" house and hopefully find him before they got there. But the energy was slowly draining out of Walker\"s tried and battered body. He soon found himself falling to the ground; the drug must have been more powerful then he thought. Walker\"s last thought was of Alex and the baby and how all he wanted to do was hold Alex in his arms and tell her he loved her. And with that final thought, all the energy Walker thought was in him was drained out and Walker slipped into darkness once again. \"Come on, just give him up, where\"s Walker being held\" Gage tried to get it out of Smith for what seemed like the hundredth time. \"And what\"s in it for me\" Smith questioned in a smart mouth voice. \"If you tell us where he is, you get immunity and you won\"t get charged with the kidnapping of a peace officer\" Gage said, hoping something would he said would get Smith to give Stevens up. \"I DIDN\"T KIDNAP A PEACE OFFICER\" Smith yelled. \"But you know where he\"s being held and the courts will look at that too. But if you tell me where he is, they will take that into consideration and you won\"t be in jail for a long\" Gage tried to convince him. \"How long will I be in jail\" Smith asked. It was Sydney who answered this time. \"5-10 years. Mainly for all the drug deals and stuff you\"ve been involved in\" \"5-10 years\" Smith repeated. \"It\"s either 5-10 or 15-20. Because they will find something else to charge you with\" Sydney told him. \"So I\"ll only be in jail for 5 years\" Smith said. \"5-10 but that\"s only if you tell us where Walker is\" Sydney explained to him. Sydney and Gage could tell by the look on Smith\"s face that he was thinking it over. Finally he spoke. \"Fine, he\"s at Stevens\" house. 1526 Northwest Street a little outside of Austin. I\"d say about 15 minutes east of Austin maybe 20 depending on traffic. But last I heard Walker had escaped so there\"s no telling where he is now\" And with that Sydney and Gage were off to Austin. Gage stopped and told another ranger what to do with Smith, but then they were off. \"Okay... Thanks Syd...Good luck...Bye\" Trivette spoke into the phone and then looked up to find Alex looking at him once again. \"What\"s going on?\" Alex asked. \"Sydney and Gage have a possible location on Walker. They know what area he\"s in and they\"re starting a search party right now. So by the end of the night, with any luck, Walker will be here. And I know how much that will make you happy\" \"As long as he\"s not hurt. Now can you do me a favor?\" Alex said before she continued. \"Go and talk to my doctor and see if you can find out when I can get out of here. They already told me what happened and that I was having contractions and they got them to stop because the baby isn\"t ready to be born yet. I know I have to be on best rest until the baby is born so it doesn\"t happen again. What I don\"t know is when I can leave the hospital. So, Jimmy please go find out. I know everything but when I can leave\" Alex finished, making sure he knew what she wanted to know and repeating herself several times. \"Okay Alex. I\"ll see what I can do\" Trivette told her. Trivette returned 15 minutes later with no luck. \"Sorry Alex. They want to keep you here until 8 tonight. They said they wanted to make sure a full day could go by without it happening again. But look on the bright side\" \"What bright side\" Alex asked. She really hated hospitals and having to stay in one was not what she thought of as a good day. \"That if all goes well, Walker will be here in time to take you home\" Trivette said hoping to get a smile out of Alex, but he was unsuccessful. \"Come on Gage, we have to keep looking\" Sydney told him. \"Sydney, remind me again why we\"re looking in this field and not along the road\" Gage replied. \"Because a guy said he saw someone matching Walker\"s description walking this way earlier today. He said he thought he saw him head into the field, which makes a little sense. If it were going to take Walker a few days to get back, he would probably go into the field, especially if he didn\"t know who was following him\" Sydney finished explaining to Gage for what seemed like the hundredth time. \"Okay, okay. But what are we looking for?\" Gage asked. \"Anything that could lead us to Walker. Any footprint, any anything. Walker\"s got to be out here\" \"Fine. Hey what\"s that over there\" Gage point to a spot in the field that looked lower then everything around it. \"I don\"t know, but lets go find out\" Sydney said as she and Gage started towards the spot. It wasn\"t Walker, but it looked like someone had been sleeping there. Just then they heard someone come up behind them. Sydney and Gage drew out their guns and turned around. It took them a minute to realize who it was. \"Walker?\" Sydney said blankly. \"What? Oh it you guys. It\"s so good to see you\" Walker said. \"Walker, what happened to you? You look horrible\" Gage spoke up. Walker went on to explain to them what had happened since he went undercover. When he was finished, Sydney and Gage didn\"t know what to say. Walker seemed to have proven once again that he was the toughest ranger in Texas. \"Okay. Well we\"ll take you to the hospital and get you checked out\" Sydney told him. \"No. I have to get to Alex\" Walker told them. \"We know. She\"s at the hospital to. And she wants you\" Sydney told him. \"What\"s wrong with Alex?\" Walker asked. \"We\"ll explain on the way home Walker. Syd are you going to call Trivette and let him know Walker\"s okay?\" Gage asked. \"I can\"t\" Sydney said as she took out her phone and looked at it. \"The battery\"s dead. Do you have yours Gage?\" Sydney asked him. \"No. You had yours so I didn\"t bring mine\" Gage told her. \"Walker, you wouldn\"t happen to have found a phone anywhere around here did you?\" Sydney now asked Walker. \"No. If I would have I would have been home hours ago. Well after that drug wore off\" Walker said. \"Well I guess we\"ll just have to surprise them at the hospital after Walker gets checked out\" Sydney declared. \"I\"m not getting checked out before I see Alex\" Walker said. \"Walker you have to get checked out. It\"ll take 5 minutes. I\"m not going to have Alex kill me because you might be hurt and I can\"t talk you into getting checked out\" \"Fine I\"ll get checked over a couple of minutes. But there\"s nothing wrong with me. I\"m fine\" Walker said. He wanted to see Alex, but knew Alex would be mad at him for not letting the doctor check him over. So with that, Walker, Sydney, and Gage all started walking to the car 5 miles away. At seven-o-clock, Trivette tried to get a hold of Sydney again. He had tried earlier and hadn\"t gotten through. \"Anything?\" Alex asked Trivette when he hung up the phone. \"Nothing. Sydney\"s isn\"t working and Gage isn\"t answering his phone\" \"I hope nothing happened to them\" Alex said worried. \"I\"m sure nothing happened to them Alex. They\"re all strong and have brains. They aren\"t going to do anything stupid and Walker is going to do anything it takes to get back here\" Trivette told her reassuringly. \"I know. I just wish I knew where they were\" Okay. There\"s the next chapter. I hope you all like it. I won\"t be writing for a few days because I need to study for my exams and write a paper (that I\"ve barely started). So I hope you all enjoyed this chapter. I tried to get it up as soon as I could. I probably won\"t post again until after I take my exams on Thursday and Friday. Again I hope you all enjoyed this chapter. Please review and let me know what you think. Author\"s Note: Story is set in November 2000. ALL the characters will be in this story at some point except CD because he died in October 2000. Now to the Reviewers: Space-Case7029: You\"ll soon see Alex\"s reaction when Walker arrives. I hope you like it. sn855850: Happy to hear you liked the cell phone scene. Here\"s the next chapter. Hope it wasn\"t too long to wait. Stephykatz: Glad to hear you thought it was a good chapter. anabuhnahnuh: Yes you were right it what you thought would happen with Walker. And I did fine on my exams. WaLkErAnDaLeX4eVeR: I\"m happy you liked it a whole lot. The birth of their baby will happen soon. Thank you to all the Reviewers. I enjoyed reading what you all had to say. Author\"s Note: Thank you to everyone who wished me good luck on my exams. I did fine. They weren\"t as hard as my teachers made them sound. I passed both of the ones I took on Thursday and the one I took today was really easy. Now if only I could get through MEAP testing then my life might be back to normal. Well that and after I take PLAN (something like the ACT that my school is making me take) then I promise I will try to post sooner. Well anyway thanks for wishing me good luck and anyone who had exams like I did, I hope you did fine. Now onto the story. Chapter 6- Making Alex Happy \"Trivette where\"s Walker\" Alex asked a few hours later. \"I don\"t know Alex. I can\"t reach Sydney or Gage on the radio and their cell phones aren\"t working. Headquarters doesn\"t have any idea where they are. I just don\"t know Alex\" Trivette said while trying to think if there was anything he could do to find Walker, Sydney, and Gage. Little did they know that Walker, Sydney, and Gage had just arrived at the hospital. Walker was getting checked out and wasn\"t in a happy mood about it. \"Stop poking me\" Walker said to the doctor for the hundredth time. \"I\"m just trying to make sure you\"re okay\" his doctor told him. Walker\"s doctor was used to him always being in a hurry. \"Will you hurry up? I have to go see my wife\" Walker said impatiently. \"I\"m almost done okay. I just need to check and draw a little blood to make sure that the drug didn\"t get into your bloodstream. And if you sit still and stop talking I\"ll be done a lot sooner\" Walker\"s doctor told him. As much as he was used to Walker acting like this by now, he still tried to get Walker to stay still. \"Walker do you want me to go let Alex know you\"re alright?\" Sydney asked him trying to think of something she could do to help need Walker calm. \"No. I want to surprise her and I want to be the one to tell her I\"m alright\" Walker said. He was happy Sydney had offered but he wanted to tell Alex. \"Where\"s Gage anyway?\" Walker asked her. \"In the cafeteria. He\"s hungry. Where else would he be?\" Sydney told him. \"Okay Walker. You\"re free to go\" his doctor told him a few minutes later. \"Thank you\" Walker said as he took off to the 5th floor to find Alex. Walker arrived on the 5th floor about a minute later. He was told by a nurse that Alex was in room number 523. So Walker headed down the hall to find her. \"Trivette I want to know where Walker is right now\" was what Walker heard coming from Alex\"s mouth as he approached the door. Walker was going to let Trivette answer, but instead he did. \"I\"m right here\" Walker said as he walked into Alex\"s room. Alex smiled for the first time in days as Walker walked over to her bed. The relief on Alex\"s face came shining through her face as Walker walked into the room and gave her a hug followed quickly by a kiss. Trivette stepped out of the room so Walker and Alex could be alone. \"Walker. Thank God. Where have you been? I\"ve missed you. No one had any idea where you were. I love you Walker and don\"t ever do anything like that to me again\" Alex said as she started to cry. \"Hey Alex its okay. I\"m right here. I love you too sweetheart. I\"m sorry you were so scared but I promise I will never let anything happen to me. Okay\" Walker said as he dried Alex\"s tears. \"Are you okay?\" He asked when Alex\"s tears started to stop. \"No I\"m not. I almost lost the baby and I\"ve been put on bed rest and I missed you and I just want to go home\" Alex said as the thought of what had happened to her in the past few days brought tears to her eyes. Walker held Alex while she cried. Letting her release all the anger and frustration and sadness that she had kept locked up inside of herself for the past few day. \"It\"s okay Alex. It\"ll all be just fine. The baby\"s okay. You\"re okay. I\"m okay. We\"re all okay. Everything is going to be just fine\" Walker kept repeating to Alex and would continue to repeat to her as long as he needed to. \"Okay. I\"ll be okay. But can you do me a favor honey?\" Alex asked him. \"Sure you just name it\" Walker said as he wiped the last of Alex\"s tears away. \"I need you to talk to my doctor. Find out when I can go home. I know I have to stay off my feet, but I want to go home. Now. But first I want you to tell me where you\"ve been\" Alex told him and Walker knowing how much she hated being in the hospital went off to find her doctor after he told", "\"I was wrong.\" I said strongly. I always hated admitting I was wrong but this I needed to do. \"Wrong?\" He said mockingly. I noticed him shift closer to me. \"Yes, I was wrong. Maybe, we could give this...\" I hadn\"t even realized what happened but he cut me off but crashing his lips against mine. His hand already was on the small of my back making me closer to him. I let my hands run through his hair. He deepened his kiss and I felt his hand roaming to my backside. I pulled away slightly just enough to break the kiss but not enough to move our bodies apart. \"We\"re in front of a church, McManus.\" He smirked and kissed me again. This time it was light and only lasted a few seconds. He pulled away and this time separated our bodies. He went to walk away but I grabbed his hand and pulled him back. \"Say something.\" He nodded and threw his arm around my waist. \"I think I never stopped loving ya.\" I smiled at him and laughed. \"Liar.\" I said mockingly. He let go of my hand and started too walk up the block. I grabbed his hand and pulled him back again. He grabbed at my waist and held onto me this time. I noticed Gerald, Murphy, and Mr. McManus coming around the corner. Murphy smirked at me and his brother and so did their father. I pushed Connor off and looked down at Gerald who had the same expression as the other two. I was hoping Connor didn\"t notice the look but he did and looked at me questionably. I started to get all fidgety. \"Come on Gerald we need to get home.\" Gerald started to walk towards the car. \"What\"s the rush? Da, wants ta get ta kno\" ya. Come have dinner with us. Ma won\"t mind.\" Murphy said. I still saw Connor who looked as if he had seen a ghost. He must have realized. \"Ah, alright. I\"ll be there in an hour.\" I noticed Connor wanted to say something so I got Gerald into the car than got in myself. I put my foot on the gas and got out of there soon as possible. It was too soon for Connor to know they were another person with McManus blood. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA...So what do you all think? Btw, I heard that Duffy may possibly be doing the sequel this summer and there was a video on St. Patrick\"s Day that got taken down. If someone can tell me if this is true or not I may conside updating sooner. ) Much love, CrimsonKissMJ. I\"m so sorry for the long wait. Life has been extremely hectic. Almost all the crazy things are over so I\"ll be able to finish this story up in the next few weeks. I think there will be only two chapters left so hope you all enjoy. To everyone who has reviewed thank you guys so much because it has inspiried me to really get these chapters up quicker than I expected. So yea rock on and to anyone who has read it I love you all too. Btw, Don\"t own the boys or any character in Boondock currently I think they are owned by Troy Duffy. This chapter is based on the song \"No Other Love\" by Chuck Prophet. Which I don\"t own either. CKMJ No other loveMama, I\"m flyin\"No other loveMama, I\"m flyin\" I can goI can go anywhereNo other loveCan take me there, ooh No other loveMama, I\"m flyin\"No other loveMama, I\"m flyin\" I can goI can go anywhereNo other loveCan take me there, ooh Mama, I\"m flyin\"Mama, I\"m flyin\" I can goI can go anywhereNo other loveCan take me there, ooh No other loveMama, I\"m flyin\"No other loveMama, I\"m flyin\" I was shaking by the time I got to the McManus\"s. This was the day all of the lies I told had to be put to stop. All the secrets I kept needed to be destroyed. I looked a little farther past there house and noticed my father\"s house lite up in the Irish sun. I had to at least go to my father first. He was the one who did raise me. So I swerved the car and drove it a little father down the road. I parked looking at the old house remembering my life there. \"Dad, I love him. I don\"t care what you say I\"m going to date Connor.\" My father grabbed my wrist and dragged me up to my room. \"I dealt with a \"nough wit ya being friends wit them but dating no fuckin\" way. They have bad blood.\" My father walked out of my room slamming the door behind him. I growled and looked out my window. Connor and Murphy stood there smirking. They must have known that telling my father wouldn\"t work out to well. So I threw down my purse and started to climb down the drain pipe. As soon as I got low enough Connor grabbed my waist and helped me the rest of the way down. When my feet were planted firmly I turned and wrapped my arms around his neck. Our lips meet and I felt butterflies form in my stomach. This was worth any fight I ever had with my father. I jumped out and got Gerald out too and made our way to the door. \"Ma, why \"re we at grandpa\"s?\" I looked down at Gerald and smiled so he didn\"t get worried. He was very keen on my senses. \"I just thought it would be nice to visit him than we can go see the McManus\"s.\" He smiled and I knocked on the door. My hands were still shaking I heard a shuffle than the door swung open. My father looked a bit shocked at both of us but he ushered us in and hugged the both of us. \"What brings ya here?\" He said concerned. \"We were just going to dinner at the McManus\"s.\" He rolled his eyes but I ignored it. \"I just thought it would be nice to stop by.\" I forced myself to smile. He came towards me and grabbed my hand. I hated when someone could tell that I was lying. \"Gerry how about you go outside and play in the field.\" I said pulling out of my father\"s grip. Gerald immediately ran outside and I turned to look at my father. He was already sitting down. \"Something\"s bothering ya.\" I nodded. He patted the seat next to him but I was too jittery to sit down. \"Dad, I thought you should hear this before I tell Connor.\" I took a long deep breath. \"I lied to you. Gerald is Connor\"s. That\"s why I left.\" I sped through the words. I was slightly hoping that he didn\"t understand me but the way he was standing I knew he did. His face turned beet red and was shaking with anger. It was the same look ever since I was child and he would get angry. I had to explain myself more to distract him from going to kill Connor. \"I found out I was pregnant a few days before I left. I was engaged so I thought it didn\"t matter. Than we broke up so I left than got married to the first person I dated after him. I never told you because I thought you would get mad at me. Like you are now.\" I looked away. He came closer and grabbed my forearms to force me to look at him. \"Connor McManus? Ya had a child with that fuck.\" He was screaming. I don\"t think he could even comprehend the volume of his voice. \"He hurt ya know ya gonna let him in ya child\"s life. I raised ya better than that.\" He let go of me and sat down. He was trying to calm his anger but it wasn\"t working. My tears were flowing onto my crimson dress. The dress I bought because Connor was taking me somewhere fancy. I also was planning on telling him that we had a little one on the way. I didn\"t get to say it though. He told me he wanted to take a break. He was lying. He wanted to break up. Now I can\"t even tell if he wanted his child. So I ran. Ran all the way home in the pouring rain. I threw the door open and ran to my room. I needed to be alone. \"Gracie, what\"s wrong?\" My father\"s voice came from the kitchen. I didn\"t stop and just ran to my room. I slammed the door shut and flung myself onto my bed. I dug my face into my pillow to muffle the sound of my tears and screaming. I heard my father come in but I didn\"t care. \"Gracie?\" \"Leave me alone.\" He sighed and sat down next to me. \"Ya got ta give up this American lass attidue.\" I dug my face a little deeper. \"What\"s wrong? Did that McManus boy hurt ya?\" I heard my father stand up. I pulled my face from the pillow and sat up. He would kill Connor if I didn\"t explain myself. I didn\"t want my father to kill him I would rather have that pleasure. \"Connor and I are over. Just leave it alone.\" My father turned red. It was something he did when he was angry. \"Dad, please relax.\" I got up and walked towards my closet. I pulled down my suitcase. \"I need to go to New York for a while. I think it would be nice to see Aunt Marie and to clear my head.\" My father slammed his fist against my wall going straight through the plaster. I felt strangely calm. \"Dad, this has nothing to do with you or Connor. I just need to get out of Ireland.\" My father turned back to his normal color and he walked out the door. I knew it would be a few days before he would talk to me again. He thought I might be saying this out of anger but I wasn\"t. I needed to go to New York. To not see Connor or Murphy or my father for a while. To make a decision about this baby. My baby. I continued to pack crying on my beautiful crimson dress and touching the stomach that held my child. \"Connor is Gerald\"s father.\" I said sternly. \"I don\"t care if he doesn\"t want him. I can\"t hold on to this secret I\"ve had for almost eight years. I just need to let him know for him and myself.\" I turned and walked out the back door. My father followed. When I walked out the door I saw Gerald playing with Connor. I was shocked to see Connor over here \"Connor, what the hell are you doing here?\" He looked odd. His color seemed back from church today and he did seem happy looking at Gerald. I felt a shiver run down my spine. \"I saw Gerald playin\" in the field. I wanted to see ya.\" He looked over my head. \"Hello Mr. Brannigan.\" I turned to my father and hugged him. I had to distract him from killing Connor. Which I knew he was fantasizing about. \"Dad, I love you and all you ever wanted was the best. This is the best for me.\" I whispered. I pulled away and kissed his cheek. I let go of him and walked towards Connor. When I turned to look back my father was gone. He finally accepted defeat. Connor looked at me and than looked down at Gerald. \"Honey, go up to the house. We\"ll be there in a few.\" Gerald ran across the field. \"I...\" My voice started to trail off. Connor spun me towards him and kissed me. I pushed back knowing that words wouldn\"t form if he continued to kiss him. \"Gerald\"s your son.\" My eyes were on the floor. I slid them up to see his reaction. I knew that he knew after church today but I needed to say it for my own selfish purposes of feeling better. I looked it to his eyes expecting a reaction. He was smiling from ear to ear. I was crying but I hadn\"t even realized. He lightly brushed the tears away with his thumb \"Why are you cryin\" love?\" He said still smiling like a fool. I wrapped my arms around his neck. We were so close I could feel his heartbeat. \"I\"m so sorry for not telling you.\" My tears didn\"t stop. He pulled at my hands and forced me out of my grip on him. He steadied me by putting his hands on my forearms. \"You did what ya had to. I was a stupid prick back than but I want ya more than eva now. Ya was the only gal for me.\" He paused and his smile disappeared. \"I wanna ask ya one thing though. Do ya want me to be his father?\" Normally I was the kind of person who thought of ever decision for hours but I couldn\"t think clearly and just nodded my head. I had waited seven years for Connor to be Gerald\"s father. There was no doubt in my mind that he wouldn\"t be a perfect dad. \"But will you stay?\" Connor looked taken back by the question. \"Will you promise to not disappear like you did?\" He grabbed me again and pulled me into a tender kiss. When he pulled away he smirked down at me. \"Does that answer your question?\" I smiled at him and nodded. \"I think it\"s time you go meet your son.\" I grabbed Connor\"s hand and we started to walk down the field back to the McManus\"s. I saw the house shone in an Irish sunset. I felt something burning inside of me. I told myself that I would turn the other cheek. Not thinking it would get this far. Not thinking I would have told all my other secrets. I jumped in front of Connor and grabbed his other hand. \"Just one more question. How will you being a saint affect my son?\" Connor\"s jaw dropped and for once a McManus had nothing to say. I know it\"s shorter than the first two chapters but this one was extremely hard to write because I scraped the first 50 ideas I had for it. So any notes or reviews will be extremely helpful for the next two chapters. Until than peace and love. CKMJ Thank God school is almost over. Hopefully, i don\"t fail because than I can\"t write as much. You all don\"t want to hear my life story so here is the next chapter. I\"m not sure if I\"m completely done with this story yet or if I have a few chapters left in me. If anything there will be only one more chapter left. Also, I want to thank everyone who has reviewed(I Fancy Hugh Dancy, BelhavenOnTap, Sith Happens,wolf-shadow666) You guys have been my inspiration and everyone who has read thanks! Anyway, back to this chapter. It\"s based on the song \"Love You Till The End\" by the Pogues and I do not own the saints(only Grace and Gerald). So enjoy! All of them stared at me at the dinner table. All lined up perfectly opposite of me waiting. Waiting for some sort of answer. Not a word escaping their lips or mine. All slightly shocked how calm I was. You would think the reason I initially was shaking was due to me knowing the identity of a mass murder, not the identity of my son\"s father. \"Is anyone going to say anything?\" I asked. Connor, who had been examining his nails for the past hour, finally looked up at the sound of my voice. A few seconds past and not another word was formed. Connor just stared straight into my eyes. \"How long ya known?\" Murphy said while playing with the cigarette in his hand. \"Since it happened. I saw it on the news. I just never expected to see you boys again,\" I said. \"Lass, ya don\"t really seem upset.\" I nodded. I wasn\"t really upset. I just needed the question to be posed for what it meant for my son. It was a dangerous game they were playing. Sure I was nervous for Connor but I mainly had to worry for my son. He was my main priority. I looked at Connor again. He got up and came around the table to be near me. He leaned down next to me, looking up at me with his blue eyes. \"Ya know, I never would put that lad in any harm.\" He laced his fingers with mine, his other hand smoothing my hair. I pushed my chair back, escaping from Connor\"s touch. \"This isn\"t a time for your Irish charm.\" I felt so calm and in control. Connor stood up and walked back to his chair. \"All I want to know if there is any chance of getting caught?\" All four of them exchanged glances. \"There\"s always a chance,\" Ma chimed in. I glanced at her than back at Connor. He stared back with intensity until Gerald ran in the room. \"Ma!\" Gerald ran up to me with a cut on his elbow. I saw in his eyes he was forcing himself not to cry. Same trait as Connor. \"How did you do that?\" He shrugged. I stood up and grabbed his hand pulling him along to the kitchen. Out of the corner of my eye I saw Connor stand up. He walked over to Gerald and I and picked him up. \"I\"ll take care of \"em.\" It took me a few moments to let go of Gerald\"s hand but I had to do it. I watched as they walked away. They looked like two perfect puzzle pieces that were always meant to fit together. I tore my eyes away to look at the three other people waiting for an answer from me. Their expressions haven\"t changed. Still sad and scared that I would expose their lives. I had to get out for a while. To not have all of our lives in my hand. I walked out without saying a word. I knew one of them was going to follow me, so I just waited on the porch steps staring into the darkness. The door swung open. I didn\"t need to turn around I could sense who was behind me. \"Can I have a cigarette?\" I said patiently waiting for Murphy\"s response. A cigarette fell in my lap. Murphy sat next to me as I put the cigarette in my trembling fingers. He leaned over and lit it for me then smiled lightly. \"How in the holy hell do ya always kno\" its me?\" I took a long drag and blew out all the air. I turned slightly and smirked. \"I\"m psychic.\" Murphy shook his head, laughing. I couldn\"t help myself but to giggle, too. After a few seconds of laughter I laid my head against Murphy\"s shoulder. \"I really need a drink.\" I said as Murphy ran his hand through my hair. \"Alcohol ain\"t gonna solve ya problems this time.\" I sighed tucking the cigarette in my hands, closing my eyes, trying to get some comfort in having Murphy next to me. \"It\"s not as bad as ya think it is.\" \"So killing people for a living isn\"t that bad?\" He tensed up and I straightened up, taking another drag. He looked at me sadly. \"Don\"t say it like that.\" He looked off into the distance. \"How do you want me to say it, Murph? You do murder people.\" \"Bad people, Grace. If you had such a problem wit it, why didn\"t ya just ignore us after ya saw us at the market?\" I sat there dumbfounded. Maybe I had just tricked my mind into believing it was all a lie. That what happened in New York wasn\"t them or maybe that I wasn\"t going to get involved. I was just going to acknowledge them. \"Murphy, get ya arse inside,\" Mr. McManus demanded. Murphy jumped at the voice and ran inside. I just waited for him to address me. He sat down next to me the same way Murphy had. I took one last drag of the cigarette and flicked it out of my hand. Neither one of us said a word for a few moments. \"Are you going to say anything?\" I asked, turning to face the alpha male of the McManus clan. \"Aye, if ya want me ta lass.\" I nodded. \"Do ya love Conner?\" I nodded again. \"Than none of this should matter.\" It was the most obvious thing in the world but because he said it, he made it seem like the greatest idea in the world. He leaned over and kissed my forehead. \"I\"m not gonna force ya to make a decision even though I won\"t mind ya as me daughter in law.\" I chuckled lightly. He stood up and walked inside, leaving me alone with my thoughts. \"Ma!\" I felt two small arms wrap around my neck. \"Hey, sweetie.\" He let go and ran in front of me. \"Why are ya crying?\" I wiped my eyes and cheeks. I hadn\"t even realized I was crying. Stupid emotions. \"I\"m not crying.\" I knew he didn\"t believe me so I had to change the subject. \"Did Connor take good care of you?\" \"Yeah, but Connor said I might not see him as much.\" Gerald sounded so sad it just broke my heart. Gerald took a real liking to Connor and I couldn\"t just rip Gerald away. What was I saying? I didn\"t want to let Connor go, I love him too much. And having Connor with me I would always be protected. There was no real danger for me and Gerald. \"Well, Connor\"s wrong,\" I said. \"Am I?\" A voice shot out behind me. I stood up and looked at Connor. He walked towards me and stopped only inches away from me. \"Maybe, we can give this a shot. I\"m not making any promises,\" I said while Connor smirked at me. He knew I was saying yes and not just giving it a shot. He leaned closer, whispering in my ear. \"Aye, ya always fall for me Irish charm.\" I pushed him away just enough to have access to his mouth. I kissed him lightly, fully aware of Gerald behind us. \"Yuck!\" Gerald said. I let go of Connor and turned around. \"One day ya gonna like a lass so much ya gonna kiss her like that,\" Conner said. \"Girls are gross.\" I clicked my tongue and he got scared for a minute. \"Not all girls, Ma. I mean you\"re not really a girl.\" He stumbled with his words. I ran to him and picked him up even though he was older than the age you would still normally pick a kid up. He yelped for me to put him down and I did. I turned slightly to usher Connor over. He came towards me and hooked his arm around my waist. \"How about we all go inside and talk?\" Gerald nodded and ran past me into the house. I smiled at Connor. Suddenly he pulled me into him kissing me lightly. \"Yum, so do I get to wake up to that every morning,\" he smirked at me. \"Ya can get more than that,\" I giggled and started to pull him into the house, but he pulled me back. \"What?\" He smiled secretively. \"Aren\"t ya forgetting something?\" I shrugged not knowing what the hell he was talking about. His hand reached into his pocket and he pulled out an all to familiar silver claddagh. I ripped it out of his hand and put it on my ring finger. My heart was pounding in my chest. \"Are you-?\" He nodded waiting for my answer. I jumped up, wrapping my legs around his waist, kissing him tenderly. I pulled away just enough to tell him yes. He spun me around a few times before we both got to dizzy to stay attached. \"What the fuck are ya two doing out here?\" Murphy inquired storming outside. I ran up to him and I threw my left hand into his face. He instantly picked me up and spun me around like his brother had done. \"I think I\"ll like ya more than me own brother.\" He finally out me down and both of them ushered me into the house. Murphy, with his arm slung around my shoulder while Connor\"s was around my waist. We were finally back and nothing was going to get in the way of our lives again. I could see it in both of their eyes. They were finally home and so was I. Who knows if we will have a happy ending? All I know is at this moment, underneath the Irish moonlight, everything was perfect. My son had a father and I was in love. Not even a saint could make life that perfect."]}
